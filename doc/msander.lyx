Msander (
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

modern sander
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) is an updated version of 
\emph on
sander
\emph default
, the basic energy minimizer and molecular dynamics program in the 
\emph on
AmberTools suite.

\emph default
 This program relaxes the structure by iteratively moving the atoms down
 the energy gradient until a sufficiently low average gradient is obtained.
 The molecular dynamics portion generates configurations of the system by
 integrating Newtonian equations of motion.
 MD will sample more configurational space than minimization, and will allow
 the structure to cross over small potential energy barriers.
 Configurations may be saved at regular intervals during the simulation
 for later analysis, and basic free energy calculations using thermodynamic
 integration may be performed.
 More elaborate conformational searching and modeling MD studies can also
 be carried out using the 
\emph on
sander
\emph default
 module.
 This allows a variety of constraints to be added to the basic force field,
 and has been designed especially for the types of calculations involved
 in NMR, Xray or cryo-EM structure refinement.

estraints, but this module is used for a variety of simulations that have
 nothing to do with NMR refinement.
 Some general features are outlined in the following paragraphs:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\shape italic
msander
\shape default
 provides direct support for several force fields for proteins and nucleic
 acids, and for several water models and other organic solvents.
 The basic force field implemented here has the following form, which is
 about the simplest functional form that preserves the essential nature
 of molecules in condensed phases:
\begin_inset Separator latexpar
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
V(\mathbf{r}) & = & \sum_{bonds}K_{b}(b-b_{0})^{2}+\sum_{angles}K_{\theta}(\theta-\theta_{o})^{2}\\
 &  & +\sum_{dihedrals}(V_{n}/2)(1+\cos[n\phi-\delta]\\
 &  & +\sum_{nonb\,ij}(A_{ij}/r_{ij}^{12})-(B_{ij}/r_{ij}^{6})+(q_{i}q_{j}/r_{ij})
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition, charges that are not centered on atoms, but are off-center
 (as for lone-pairs or "extra points") can be included in the force field.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
The particle-mesh Ewald (PME) procedure is used to handle long-range electrostat
ic interactions.
 Long-range van der Waals interactions are estimated by a continuum model.
 Biomolecular simulations in the NVE ensemble (
\begin_inset Formula $i.e.$
\end_inset

 with Newtonian dynamics) conserve energy well over multi-nanosecond runs
 without modification of the equations of motion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Translational periodic (P1) symmetry is supported, but no other space-group
 symmetry is.
 The size of the unit cell can be coupled to a given external pressure,
 and velocities can be coupled to a given external temperature by several
 schemes.
 The external conditions and coupling constants can be varied over time,
 so various simulated annealing protocols can be specified in a simple and
 flexible manner.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
It is also possible to carry out non-periodic simulations in which aqueous
 solvation effects are represented 
\shape italic
implicitly
\shape default
 by a generalized Born/ surface area model by adding the following two terms
 to the "vacuum" potential function:
\begin_inset Separator latexpar
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\Delta G_{sol}=\sum_{ij}(1-\frac{1}{\varepsilon})(q_{i}q_{j}/f_{GB}(r_{ij})+A\sum_{i}\sigma_{i}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first term accounts for the polar part of solvation (free) energy, designed
 to provide an approximation for the reaction field potential, and the second
 represents the non-polar contribution which is taken to be proportional
 to the surface area of the molecule.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Users can define internal restraints on bonds, valence angles, and torsions,
 and the force constants and target values for the restraints can vary during
 the simulation.
 The relative weights of various terms in the force field can be varied
 over time, allowing one to implement a variety of simulated annealing protocols
 in a single run.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Internal restraints can be defined to be "time-averaged", that is, restraint
 forces are applied based on the averaged value of an internal coordinate
 over the course of the dynamics trajectory, not only on its current value.
 Alternatively, restraints can be "ensemble-averaged" using the locally-enhanced
-sampling (LES) option.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Restraints can be directly defined in terms of NOESY intensities (calculated
 with a relaxation matrix technique), residual dipolar couplings, scalar
 coupling constants and proton chemical shifts.
 There are provisions for handling overlapping peaks or ambiguous assignments.
 In conjunction with distance and angle constraints, this provides a powerful
 and flexible approach to NMR structural refinements.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Xray and cryoEM refinements can be carried out in reciprocal space, with
 GPU-accelerated structure factor calculations.
 Real-space electron density maps can also be used as restraints for refinement.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Replica exchange calculations can allow simultaneous sampling at a variety
 of conditions (such as temperature), and allow the user to construct Boltzmann
 samples in ways that converge more quickly than standard MD simulations.
 Other variants of biased MD simulations can also be used to improve sampling.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Restraints can also be defined in terms of the root-mean-square coordinate
 distance from some reference structure.
 This allows one to bias trajectories either towards or away from some target.
 Free energies can be estimated from non-equilibrium simulations based on
 targetting restraints.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Free energy calculations, using thermodynamic integration (TI) with a linear
 or non-linear mixing of the "unperturbed" and "perturbed" Hamiltonian,
 can be carried out.
 Alternatively, potentials of mean force can be computed using umbrella
 sampling.

Namelist Input Syntax
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Namelist provides list-directed input, and convenient specification of default
 values, and is a part of the Fortran 90 standard, Namelist input groups
 take the form:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
&name
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
var1=value, var2=value, var3(sub)=value,
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
var4(sub,sub,sub)=value,value,
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
var5=repeat*value,value,
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
/
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The variables must be names in the Namelist variable list.
 The order of the variables in the input list is of no significance, except
 that if a variable is specified more than once, later assignments may overwrite
 earlier ones.
 Blanks may occur anywhere in the input, except embedded in constants (other
 than string constants, where they count as ordinary characters).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is common in older inputs for the ending "/" to be replaced by "&end";
 this is non-standard-conforming.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Letter case is ignored in all character comparisons, but case is preserved
 in string constants.
 String constants must be enclosed by single quotes (').
 If the text string itself contains single quotes, indicate them by two
 consecutive single quotes, e.g.
 C1' becomes 'C1
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

' as a character string constant.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Array variables may be subscripted or unsubscripted.
 An unsubscripted array variable is the same as if the subscript (1) had
 been specified.
 If a subscript list is given, it must have either one constant, or exactly
 as many as the number in the declared dimension of the array.
 Bounds checking is performed for ALL subscript positions, although if only
 one is given for a multi-dimension array, the check is against the entire
 array size, not against the first dimension.
 If more than one constant appears after an array assignment, the values
 go into successive locations of the array.
 It is NOT necessary to input all elements of an array.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Any constant may optionally be preceded by a positive (1,2,3,..) integer repeat
 factor, so that, for example, 25*3.1415 is equivalent to twenty-five successive
 values 3.1415.
 The repeat count separator, *, may be preceded and followed by 0 or more
 blanks.
 Valid LOGICAL constants are 0, F, .F., .FALSE., 1, T, .T., and .TRUE.; lower case
 versions of these also work.

\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
Although sander will write energy information in the output files (using
 
\shape italic
ntpr
\shape default
), it is often desirable to calculate the energies of a set of structures
 at a later point.
 In particular, one may wish to post-process a set of structures using a
 different energy function than was used to generate the structures.
 An example of this is MM-PBSA analysis, where the explicit water is removed
 and replaced with a continuum model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If 
\shape italic
imin
\shape default
 is set to 5, sander will read a trajectory file (the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

inptraj
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 argument, specified using 
\family typewriter
-y
\family default
 on the command line), and will perform the functions described in the mdin
 file (e.g., an energy minimization) for each of the structures in this file.
 The final structure from each minimization will be written out to the normal
 mdcrd file.
 If you wish to read in a binary (i.e., NetCDF format) trajectory, be sure
 to set 
\shape italic
ioutfm
\shape default
 to 1 (see below).
 Note that this will result in the output trajectory having NetCDF format
 as well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, when 
\shape italic
imin
\shape default
 = 5 and 
\shape italic
maxcyc
\shape default
 = 1000, sander will minimize each structure in the trajectory for 1000
 steps and write a minimized coordinate set for each frame to the mdcrd
 file.
 If 
\shape italic
maxcyc
\shape default
 = 1, the output file can be used to extract the energies of each of the
 coordinate sets in the inptraj file.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Trajectories containing box coordinates can be post-processed.
 In order to read trajectories with box coordinates, 
\shape italic

\end_layout

\series bold
IMPORTANT CAVEAT:
\series default
 The initial coordinates input file used (
\family typewriter
-c
\family default
\shape italic
 
\shape default
<inpcrd>) should be the same as the initial coordinates input file used
 to generate the original trajectory.
 This is because sander sets up parameters for PME from the box coordinates
 in the initial coordinates input file.

10 Stochastic Isokinetic Nose-Hoover RESPA integrator 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 A novel isokinetic integrator developed by Tuckerman and co-workers that

\emph on

\emph default
 (see below) auxiliary thermostat velocities 
\emph on
v1
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
v2
\emph default
.
 The integrator includes a stochastic component in the equations of motion,
 which introduces white noise into the system, for the purpose of minimizing
 resonance instabilities in the velocities, ultimately allowing for larger
 RESPA steps.
 The isokinetic constraint has the form 
\begin_inset Formula $mv^{2}+\frac{L}{L+1}\sum_{i=1}^{L}Q_{1}v_{1i}^{2}=Lk_{B}T$
\end_inset

 Here 
\emph on

 as

\emph on

\begin_inset Formula $v$

\emph default

\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

, are the particle mass, Boltzmann constant, and system temperature (
\emph on

\emph default
), respectively.
 In using this integrator, the system is placed in the isokinetic ensemble,
 as such the velocities are NOT canonical and no thermodynamic observables
 can be derived from them.
 This will lead to anomalous temperature readings throughout the simulation
 - for 1 thermostat degree of freedom (
\emph on

 In particular, typically NTF = NTC.) The SHAKE option should be used for
 most MD calculations.
 The size of the MD timestep is determined by the fastest motions in the
 system.
 SHAKE removes the bond stretching freedom, which is the fastest motion,
 and consequently allows a larger timestep to be used.
 For water models, a special "three-point" algorithm is used.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For a periodic system, constant pressure is the only way to equilibrate
 density if the starting state is not correct.
 For example, the solvent packing scheme used in LEaP can result in a net
 void when solvent molecules are subtracted which can aggregate into "vacuum
 bubbles" in a constant volume run.
 Another potential problem are small gaps at the edges of the box.
 The upshot is that almost every system needs to be equilibrated at constant
 pressure (
\shape italic

) to get to a proper density.
 But be sure to equilibrate first (at constant volume) to something close

\begin_layout Standard
The Particle Mesh Ewald (PME) method is always "on", unless 
\shape italic
ntb
\shape default

 PME is a fast implementation of the Ewald summation method for calculating
 the full electrostatic energy of a unit cell (periodic box) in a macroscopic
 lattice of repeating images.
 The PME method is fast since the reciprocal space Ewald sums are B-spline
 interpolated on a grid and since the convolutions necessary to evaluate
 the sums are calculated via fast Fourier transforms (FFTs).
 Note that the accuracy of the PME method is related to the density of the
 charge grid (NFFT1, NFFT2, and NFFT3), the spline interpolation order (ORDER),
 and the direct sum tolerance (DSUM_TOL); see the descriptions below for
 more information.
\end_layout

The PME method was implemented originally in Amber 3a by Tom Darden and

 These give the size of the charge grid (upon which the reciprocal sums

 Higher values lead to higher accuracy (when the DSUM_TOL is also lowered)
 but considerably slow the calculation.
 Generally it has been found that reasonable results are obtained when NFFT1,
 NFFT2 and NFFT3 are approximately equal to A, B and C, respectively, leading
 to a grid spacing (A/NFFT1, etc.) of 1.0 √Ö.
 Significant performance enhancement in the calculation of the fast Fourier

\begin_layout Description
IINC: If IINC = 0, then forces for the class of time-averaged restraints
 will be calculated exactly as (dE/dr_ave) (dr_ave/dx).
 If IINC = 1, then then forces for the class of time-averaged restraints
 will be calculated as (dE/dr_ave) (dr(t)/dx).
 Note that this latter method results in a non-conservative force, and does
 not integrate to a standard form.
 But this latter formulation helps avoid the large forces due to the (1+

 term in the exact derivative calculation‚Äìand may avert instabilities in
 the molecular dynamics trajectory for some systems.

Changes to RSTAR result in exponential weighting changes to the attractive

 For this reason, scaling RSTAR to a very small value (e.g.

Note that an Ewald coefficient of 0.35 is close to the default error for
 an 8 Angstrom cutoff.
 However, the first job used an 11 Angstrom cutoff.
 The direct sum forces calculated in the 2nd job are compared to these,
 giving the RMS error due to an 8 Angstrom cutoff, with this value of ew_coeff.
 The reciprocal sum error calculated in the 2nd job is with respect to the
 pme reciprocal forces in the 1st job considered as "exact".
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note further that if in these two jobs you had not specified "ew_coeff"
 
\shape italic
sander
\shape default
 would have calculated ew_coeff according to the cutoff and the direct sum
 tolerance, defaulted to 10
\begin_inset Formula $^{-5}$

 This would give two different ewald coefficients.
 Under these circumstances the direct, reciprocal and adjust energies and
 forces would not agree well between the two jobs.
 However the total energy and forces should agree reaso

The

 This mode allows multiple independent simulations, or replicas, to be run
 in the same program instance.
 It is particularly useful for computer clusters in which priority is given
 to large CPU-count jobs.
 In this case, the command-line usage of sander and pmemd is slightly altered,
 as shown below:
\end_layout

\family default
 individual simulations (
\family typewriter

\family typewriter
#group

 The groupfile consists of a number of lines which is the command-line for
 each of the 
\family typewriter
#groups
\family default
 simulations you wish to run.
 Comment lines (i.e., those with # in the first column) are ignored, after
 which the first

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The multisander and multipmemd mechanisms are also utilized for methods

 (both described later).
 An example groupfile and program call are shown below.

 In standard simulations (

), the provided suffix will be applied only to output files that are printed
 but were not given names on the command-line.
 With multisander, however, each thread has to produce different output
 files so that different replicas do not try to write to the same file.
 As a result, a default suffix of 000, 001, 002, etc.
 is given to the replicas and is added to every unspecified output file.
 If a 
\family typewriter

\family default
 is specified in the groupfile, as shown above, every output file‚Äîincluding
 those given an explicit name for that replica‚Äîare given the additional
 suffix.

The Generalized Born/Surface Area Model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Implicit solvent methods can speed up atomistic simulations by approximating
 the discrete solvent as a continuum, thus drastically reducing the number
 of particles in the system.
 An additional effective speedup often comes from much faster sampling of
 the conformational space afforded by these methods.

 The generalized Born (GB) solvation model is the most commonly used implicit
 solvent model for atomistic MD simulation; it has been most widely tested
 on ff99SB and ff14SBonlysc, but in principle could be used with other non-polar
izable force fields, such as ff03.
 A recent (2019) review gives a good overview.

 To estimate the total solvation free energy of a molecule, 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta G_{solv}$
\end_inset

, one typically assumes that it can be decomposed into the "electrostatic"
 and "non-electrostatic" parts:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\Delta G_{solv}=\Delta G_{el}+\Delta G_{nonel}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta G_{nonel}$
\end_inset

 is the free energy of solvating a molecule from which all charges have
 been removed (i.e.
 partial charges of every atom are set to zero), and 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta G_{el}$
\end_inset

 is the free energy of first removing all charges in the vacuum, and then
 adding them back in the presence of a continuum solvent environment.
 Generally speaking, 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta G_{nonel}$
\end_inset

 comes from the combined effect of two types of interaction: the favorable
 van der Waals attraction between the solute and solvent molecules, and
 the unfavorable cost of breaking the structure of the solvent (water) around
 the solute.
 In the current Amber codes, this is taken to be proportional to the total
 solvent accessible surface area (SA) of the molecule, with a proportionality
 constant derived from experimental solvation energies of small non-polar
 molecules, and uses a fast LCPO algorithm

The Poisson-Boltzmann approach described in the next section has traditionally
 been used in calculating 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta G_{el}$
\end_inset

.
 However, in molecular dynamics applications, the associated computational
 costs are often very high, as the Poisson-Boltzmann equation needs to be
 solved every time the conformation of the molecule changes.
 Amber developers have pursued an alternative approach, the analytic generalized
 Born (GB) method, to obtain a reasonable, computationally efficient estimate
 to be used in molecular dynamics simulations.
 The methodology has become popular,

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 due to its relative simplicity and computational efficiency, compared to
 the more standard numerical solution of the Poisson-Boltzmann equation.
 Within Amber GB models, each atom in a molecule is represented as a sphere
 of radius 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{i}$
\end_inset

 with a charge

 The molecule is surrounded by a solvent of a high dielectric

 The effective Born radius of an atom reflects the degree of its burial
 inside the molecule: for an isolated ion, it is equal to its van der Waals
 (VDW) radius 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 Then one obtains the particularly simple form:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\Delta G_{el}=-\frac{q_{i}^{2}}{2\rho_{i}}\left(1-\frac{1}{\varepsilon}\right)\label{eq:Born}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where we assumed 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa=0$
\end_inset

 (pure water).
 This is the famous expression due to Born for the solvation energy of a
 single ion.
 The function 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{GB}()$
\end_inset

 is designed to interpolate, in a clever manner, between the limit 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{ij}\rightarrow0$
\end_inset

, when atomic spheres merge into one, and the opposite extreme 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{ij}\rightarrow\infty$
\end_inset

, when the ions can be treated as point charges obeying the Coulomb's law.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 For deeply buried atoms, the effective radii are large, 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{i}\gg\rho_{i}$
\end_inset

, and for such atoms one can use a rough estimate 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{i}\approx L_{i}$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{i}$
\end_inset

 is the distance from the atom to the molecular surface.
 Closer to the surface, the effective radii become smaller, and for a completely
 solvent exposed side-chain one can expect 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{i}$
\end_inset

 to approach 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{i}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The effective radii depend on the molecule's conformation, and so have to
 be re-computed every time the conformation changes.
 This makes the computational efficiency a critical issue, and various approxima

\end_inset

 With the exception of GBNSR6 (see Section

 around the atom by the Coulomb field.
 Within this assumption, the following expression can be derived:

\end_inset

where the integral is over the solute volume surrounding atom 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 For a realistic molecule, the solute boundary (molecular surface) is anything
 but trivial, and so further approximations are made to obtain a closed-form

 The 3D integral used in the estimation of the effective radii is performed
 over the van der Waals (VDW) spheres of solute atoms, which implies a definitio

 For macromolecules, this approach tends to underestimate the effective
 radii for buried atoms,
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

 arguably because the standard integration procedure treats the small vacuum‚Äìfil

 being filled with water, even for structures with large interior.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 This error is expected to be greatest for deeply buried atoms characterized
 by large effective radii, while for the surface atoms it is largely canceled
 by the opposing error arising from the Coulomb approximation, which tends

\begin_layout Standard
The deficiency of the model described above can, to some extent, be corrected
 by noticing that even the optimal packing of hard spheres, which is a reasonabl
e assumption for biomolecules, still occupies only about three quarters
 of the space, and so "scaling-up" of the integral by a factor of four thirds
 should effectively increase the underestimated radii by about the right
 amount, without any loss of computational efficiency.
 This idea was developed and applied in the context of pH titration,
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Onufriev00"

\end_inset

 where it was shown to improve the performance of the GB approximation in
 calculating pKa values of protein sidechains.
 However, the one-parameter correction introduced in Ref.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

 was not optimal in keeping the model's established performance on small
 molecules.
 It was therefore proposed 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Onufriev04"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 to re-scale the effective radii with the re-scaling parameters being proportion
al to the degree of the atom's burial, as quantified by the value 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{i}$
\end_inset

 of the 3D integral.
 The latter is large for the deeply buried atoms and small for exposed ones.
 Consequently, one seeks a well-behaved re-scaling function, such that 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{i}\approx(\rho_{i}^{-1}-I_{i})^{-1}$
\end_inset

 for small 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{i}$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{i}>(\rho_{i}^{-1}-I_{i})^{-1}$
\end_inset

 when 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{i}$
\end_inset

 becomes large.
 The following simple, infinitely differentiable re-scaling function was
 chosen to replace the model's original expression for the effective radii:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
R_{i}^{-1}=\tilde{\rho}_{i}^{-1}-\rho_{i}^{-1}\tanh(\alpha\Psi-\beta\Psi^{2}+\gamma\Psi^{3})

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi=I_{i}\tilde{\rho}_{i}$

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 are treated as adjustable dimensionless parameters which were optimized
 using the guidelines mentioned earlier (primarily agreement with the PB).
 Currently, Amber supports two GB models ( termed OBC ) based on this idea.
 These differ by the values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$

Despite these limitations, implicit treatment of solvent is widely used

 speed and conformational sampling.

\end_inset

 Implicit solvent methods can be algorithmically/computationally faster,
 as measured by simulation time steps per processor (CPU) time, because
 the vast number of individual interactions between the atoms of individual
 solvent molecules do not need to be explicitly computed.
 Implicit-solvent simulations can also sample conformational space faster
 in the low viscosity regime afforded by the implicit solvent model.

 To some extent, the interest in implicit-solvent-based simulations is motivated
 by the need to sample very large conformational spaces for problems such
 as protein folding, binding-affinity calculations, or large-scale fluctuations
 of nucleosomal DNA fragments.
 The speedup of conformational change can vary considerably, depending on
 the details of the transition, and can range from no speedup at all to
 almost a 100-fold speedup.

 Unlike its use in explicit solvent PME simulations, short nonbonded cutoff

 Essentially, any cutoff values other than

 can lead to artifacts.
 Current GPU implementation of the GB can not use cutoffs.
 An alternative that retains most of the speed of the GB with a cutoff,
 but without most of its artifacts, is GB-HCP described in Section

 If the nonbonded cutoff is used in GB calculations, it should be greater
 than that for PME calculations, perhaps cut=16.
 The slowly-varying forces generally do not have to be evaluated at every
 step for GB, either nrespa=2 or 4, although that option may lead to some
 artifacts as well.

 Within this model, the effective Born radii are re-scaled to account for

 In that sense,

 This model uses a pairwise correction term to

 to approximate a molecular surface dielectric boundary; that is to eliminate
 interstitial regions of high dielectric smaller than a solvent molecule.
 This correction affects all atoms and is geometry-specific, going beyond
 the geometry-free, "average" re-scaling approach of

 With this method, you should use the bondi radii set.
 The overlap or screening parameters in the

 HNC works well in many situations, including charged particles, but has

 Also, as the bridge term is generally repulsive, HNC allows particles to
 approach too closely, overestimating non-Coulombic interactions

Like HNC, KH handles Coulombic systems well but overestimates non-Coulombic
 interactions.
 Unlike HNC, it does not have difficulties with highly asymmetric particle
 sizes and readily converges to stable solutions for almost all systems

Calculating a 3D-RISM solution for a single solute conformation typically
 requires about 100 times more computer time than the same calculation with
 explicit solvent or PB.
 While there are other factors to consider, such as sampling confined solvent
 or overall efficiency of sampling in the whole statistical ensemble at
 once, this can be prohibitive for many applications.
 Memory is also an issue as the 3D correlation grids require anywhere from
 a few megabytes for the smallest solutes to gigabytes for large complexes.
 A lower bound and very good estimate for the total memory required is
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}

\begin_inset Formula $N^{\text{V}}$

\begin_inset Formula $N_{\text{MDIIS}}$

 are stored in real-space only and require a full grid for each solvent.
 
\begin_inset Formula $c^{\text{UV}}$

 Memory, therefore, scales linearly with 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{\text{box}}$
\end_inset

 while computation time scales as 
\begin_inset Formula $O(N_{\text{box}}\log(N_{\text{box}}))$
\end_inset

 due to the requirements of calculating the 3D fast Fourier transform (3D-FFT).
 To overcome these requirements, two options are available beyond optimizations
 already in place, multiple time steps and parallelization.
 Multiple time step methods are available only in sander (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "chap:sander"

\end_inset

) and are applicable to molecular dynamics calculations only.
 Parallelization is available for all calculations but is limited by system
 size and computational resources.

\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 for NAB compiling instructions) that distribute both memory requirements
 and computational load.
 As memory is distributed, the aggregate memory of many computers can be
 used to perform calculations on very large systems.
 Memory distribution is handled by the FFTW 3.3 library so decomposition
 is done along the z-axis.
 If a variable solvation box size is used, the only consideration is to
 avoid specifying a large, prime number of processes (
\begin_inset Formula $\ge7$
\end_inset

).
 For fixed box sizes, the number of grids points in each dimension must
 be divisible by two (a general requirement) and the number of grid points
 in the z-axis must be divisible by the number of processes.
 
\family typewriter
sander.MPI
\family default
 also has the additional consideration that the number of processes cannot
 be larger than the number of solute residues; 
\family typewriter

Numerical Accuracy
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "subsec:RISM-Numerical-Accuracy"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Numerical accuracy depends on the residual tolerance specified for the numerical
 solution at runtime and the solvation box physical size and grid spacing.
 In most cases, you will need to test these parameters to ensure you have
 the accuracy required.
 As a rough guide, the numerical error in the solvation free energy is related
 to the tolerance by
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\epsilon_{\Delta G_{\text{solv}}}\approx10\times\text{tolerance}.\label{eq:rism_obs_err_tol}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

\begin_layout Standard
Molecular dynamics 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

, minimization and trajectory post-processing 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Genheden10"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 have different requirements for the maximum residual tolerance.
 Molecular dynamics does well with a tolerance of 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{-5}$
\end_inset

 and 
\family typewriter
npropagate=5
\family default
.
 Minimization requires tolerances of 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{-11}$
\end_inset

 or lower and is typically limited to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathtt{drms}\ge10^{-4}$
\end_inset

.
 Trajectory post-processing for MM/RISM should use enough digits to obtain
 the necessary accuracy when differences in solvation free energy are computed.
 For example, if a error 
\begin_inset Formula $<\unit[0.2]{kcal/mol}$
\end_inset

 is required for 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\Delta G{}_{\text{solv}}$
\end_inset

, then 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta G_{\text{solv}}$
\end_inset

 should be computed with an absolute error of 
\begin_inset Formula $\unit[0.1]{kcal/mol}$
\end_inset

.
 The relative error required to achieve this depends on the magnitude of
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta G_{\text{solv}}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Almost all applications should use a grid spacing of 0.3 to 0.5
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

√Ö or smaller.
 A larger grid spacing quickly leads to severe errors in thermodynamic quantitie
s.
 Smaller grid spacing may be necessary for some applications (e.g., mapping
 potentials of mean force).

Closure Bootstrap
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When a PSE-

 issues is to use a low order closure

\end_layout

\end_inset

 solution as a starting guess.
 The KH closure should be the starting point as it is numerically robust
 and, typically, converges easily in the vast majority of case.
 After this, higher orders of PSE-
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 can be used until the desired closure is reached.
 The procedure for 1D-RISM and 3D-RISM differs slightly in practice.
\end_layout

This is the number of trial solutions that are saved for predicting a new

 The optimal number for rapid convergence is typically 10 for 3D-RISM and

 However, for 3D-RISM, the default choice of 5 requires much less memory
 and is computationally faster even though more iterations are required.
 Increasing the

\begin_layout Standard
Occasionally, the MDIIS routine goes in the wrong direction and the residual
 increases significantly.
 If it increases more than 
\emph on
mdiis_restart
\emph default
 then the MDIIS routine selects the solution with the lowest residual and
 purges the other trial solutions.
 The default value of 10 can be too aggressive and cause the solver to cycle.
 Increasing the value to 100 or 1000 sometimes allows the solver to recover
 from a misstep.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Parameter Annealing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Chargeless, hot gases are the easiest systems to converge.
 For 1D-RISM, this can be used to bootstrap a solution in a similar manner
 to closure bootstrapping.
 By slowly turning on charges, lowering the temperature or increasing the
 density, a converged solution may be reached.
 This only works for 1D-RISM because it requires restarting from a previous
 solution.
 As with closure bootstrapping, files should be carefully renamed during
 the procedure.
 There is no general protocol but the parameter increment should be reduced
 as the target value is approached.
 E.g., turning on charges in a linear fashion usually isn't helpful.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Forcefield selection
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The forcefield may affect convergence due to the number of solvent sites
 involved or the particular parameters of the forcefield.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Number of Sites
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Molecules with more sites are more difficult to converge.
 Six or more sites is already difficult to converge and more that 10 may
 not be possible under any circumstances.
 One solution is to use a united atom or coarse grained forcefields to reduce
 the number of sites.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Alternate Parameterization
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some parameter sets simply yield a stiffer set of equations to solve.
 Choosing an alternate parameter set may allow convergence with only small
 differences in the numerical results.
 For example, the cSPC/E water model with SPC/E Joung/Cheatham ions is easier
 to converge at higher ion concentrations in 1D-RISM than cTIP3P water with
 TIP3P Joung/Cheatham ions.
 Both models give nearly identical results in RISM at lower concentrations
 but NaCl in cTIP3P water will not converge above 0.5 M for the PSE-3 closure
 despite using all of the above methods.

[1e-5] A list of maximum residual values for solution convergence.
 When used in combination with a list of closures it is possible to define
 different tolerances for each of the closures.
 This can be useful for difficult to converge calculations (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "subsec:rism_convergence"

\end_inset

 for details).
 For the sake of efficiency, it is best to use as high a tolerance as possible
 for all but the last closure.
 For minimization a tolerance of 1e-11 or lower is recommended.

 calculations.
 A principal current use is as a replacement for MOPAC for deriving AM1-bcc
 charges, but the code is much more general than that.
 Presently, it is limited to single point calculations and energy minimizations
 (geometry optimizations) for closed-shell systems.
 It supports a wide variety of semi-empirical Hamiltonians, including many
 recent ones.
 An external electric field generated by a set of point charges can be included
 for single point calculations.
 Our plan is to add capabilities to subsequent versions.

 core repulsion function for interactions between QM and MM atoms.
 Parameters for the exponents

 of the QM atoms are taken from PM3 (a default value of five is used for

 of the MM atoms as is the case for MNDO, AM1 and PM3).
 Since PM3 does not have parameters for all elements that are supported
 by PM6, the missing exponents were defined in an ad hoc manner (see the

 Controls which diagonalization routine will be used during the SCF procedure.
 This is an advanced option to fine-tune performance which has negligible
 effect on energies (and generally little effect on geometries in the case
 of SQM energy minimizations).
 The speed of each diagonalizer is a function of the number and type of
 QM atoms as well as the LAPACK library that the program was linked to.
 As such there is not always an obvious choice to obtain the best performance.
 The simplest option is to set diag_routine = 0 in which case the program
 will test each diagonalizer in turn, including the pseudo diagonalizer,
 and select the one that gives optimum performance.

itrmax
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Integer specifying the maximum number of SCF iterations to perform before
 assuming that convergence has failed.
 Default is 1000.
 Typically higher values will not do much good since if the SCF hasn't converged
 after 1000 steps it is unlikely to.
 If the convergence criteria have not been met after itrmax steps the SCF
 will stop and the minimisation will proceed with the gradient at itrmax.
 Hence if you have a system which does not converge well you can set itrmax
 smaller so less time is wasted before assuming the system won't converge.
 In this way you may be able to get out of a bad geometry quite quickly.
 Once in a better geometry SCF convergence should improve.

attempts
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Controls the number of iterations that DIIS (direct inversion of the iterative
 subspace) extrapolations will be attempted.
 Not available for DFTB/SCC-DFTB.
 The SCF does not even begin to exhaust its attempts at using DIIS extrapolation
s until the end of iteration 100.
 Therefore, for example, if ndiis_attempts=50, then DIIS extrapolations
 would be performed at end of iterations 100 to 150.
 The purpose of not performing DIIS extrapolations before iteration 100
 is because the existing code base performs quite well for most molecules;
 however, if convergence is not met after 100 iterations, then it is presumed
 that further iterations will not yield SCF convergence without doing something
 different, i.e., DIIS.
 Thus, the implementation of DIIS in SQM is a mechanism to try and force
 SCF convergence for molecules that are otherwise difficult to converge.
 Default 0.
 Maximum 1000.
 Minimum 0.
 Note that DIIS will automatically turn itself on for 100 attempts at the
 end of iteration 800 even if you did not explicitly set ndiis_attempts
 to a nonzero value.
 This is done as a final effort to achieve convergence.

 When running QM calculations in the sqm program, an electric field of external

 contribution.
 Like QM/MM calculations (see

The current implementation limits use of external charges to only single

 To run such a calculation, an additional field, which begins with #EXCHARGES

 the input.
 Each external point charge must include atomic number, atom name, X, Y,
 Z coordinates and the charge in units of the electron charge.

Amber Masks
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A "mask" is a notation which selects atoms or residues for special treatment.
 A frequent usage is fixing or tethering selected atoms or residues during
 minimization or molecular dynamics.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The following lines are partially copied from the original AMBER documentation.
 For more details, refer to the entire section of that documentation describing
 the 
\emph on
ambmask
\emph default
 utility.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The "mask" selection expression is composed of "elementary selections".
 These start with "
\series bold
:
\series default
" to select by residues, or "
\series bold
@
\series default
" to select by atoms.
 Residues can be selected by numbers (given as numbers separated by commas,
 or as ranges separated by a dash) or by names (given as a list of residue
 names separated by commas).
 The same holds true for atom selections by atom numbers or atom names.
 In addition, atoms can be selected by AMBER atom type, in which case "@"
 must be immediately followed by "%".
 The notation ":*" means all residues and "@*" means all atoms.
 The following examples show the usage of this syntax.

 (by default, in Amber-style PDB format).
 Atom and residue names and numbers are taken from the Amber topology.
 Beware that the selection string works on those names and not the ones
 from the original PDB file.
 If you are not sure how atoms or residues are named or numbered in the
 Amber topology, use 
\series bold
ambmask
\series default
 with a selection string ":*" (which is the default) to dump the whole PDB
 file with corresponding Amber atom/residue names and numbers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The "maskstr" selection expression is composed of "elementary selections".
 These start with ":" to select by residues, or "@" to select by atoms.
 Residues can be selected by numbers (given as numbers separated by commas,
 or as ranges separated by a dash) or by names (given as a list of residue
 names separated by commas).
 The same holds true for atom selections by atom numbers or atom names.
 In addition, atoms can be selected by Amber atom type, in which case "@"
 must be immediately followed by "%".
 ":*" means all residues and "@*" means all atoms.
 The following examples show the usage of this syntax.
 Square brackets should not be used in actual expressions, they are only
 used below to denote individual selection string examples:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
:{residue numlist} [:1-10] [:1,3,5] [:1-3,5,7-9]
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

@{atom namelist} [@CA] [@CA,C,O,N,H]
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
@%{atom typelist} [@%CT] [@%N*,N3]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These "elementary selections" can be combined into more complex selections
 using binary operators "&" (and) and "
\begin_inset Formula $\vert$
\end_inset

" (or), unary operator "!" (negation), distance binary operators "
\begin_inset Formula $<$
\end_inset

:", "
\begin_inset Formula $>$
\end_inset

:", "
\begin_inset Formula $<$
\end_inset

@", "
\begin_inset Formula $>$
\end_inset

@", and parentheses.
 Spaces around operators are irrelevant.
 Parentheses have the highest priority, followed by distance operators ("
\begin_inset Formula $<$
\end_inset

:", "
\begin_inset Formula $>$
\end_inset

:", "
\begin_inset Formula $<$
\end_inset

@", "
\begin_inset Formula $>$
\end_inset

@"), "!" (negation), "&" (and) and "
\begin_inset Formula $\vert$
\end_inset

" (or) in order of descending priority.
 A wildcard "=" in an atom or residue name matches any name starting with
 a given character (or characters).
 For example, [:AS=] would match all aspartic acid residues (ASP), and asparagin
es (ASN); [@H=] would match all atom names starting with H (which are effectivel
y all hydrogens).
 It cannot be used to match the end part of names (such as [:=A]).
 Some examples of more complex selections follow:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

 all carbons except backbone alpha and carbonyl carbon

\begin_layout Description
OPTIONS
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The program needs an Amber topology file and coordinates (restrt format).
 The filename specified with the -
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 option is Amber topology, while the filename given with the -
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 option is a coordinate file.
 If -
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 or -
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 options are not given, the program expects that files "prmtop" and/or "inpcrd"
 exist in the current directory, which will be taken as topology and coordinate
 files correspondingly.
 If no command line options are given, the program prints the usage statement.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The option 
\shape italic
-prnlev
\shape default
 specifies how much (debugging) information is printed to 
\series bold
stdout
\series default
.
 If it is 0, only selected atoms are printed.
 More verbose output (which might be useful for debugging purposes) is achieved
 with higher values: 1 prints original "maskstr" in its tokenized (with
 operands enclosed in square brackets) and postfix (or Reverse Polish Notation)
 forms; number of atoms and residues in the topology file and number of
 selected atoms are also printed to 
\series bold
stdout
\series default
.
 2 prints the resulting mask array, which is an array of integer values,
 with '1' representing a selected atom, and '0' an unselected one.
 Value of 3, in addition, prints mask arrays as they are pushed or popped
 from the stack (this is really only useful for tracing the problems occurring
 during stack operations).
 The 
\shape italic
-prnlev
\shape default
 values of 0 or 1 should suffice for most uses.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The option 
\shape italic
-out
\shape default
 specifies the format of printed atoms.
 "short" means a condensed output using residue (:) and atom (@) designators
 followed by residue ranges and atom names.
 "pdb" (default) prints atoms in Amber-style PDB format with the original
 "maskstr" printed as a REMARK at the top of the PDB file, and "amber" prints
 atom/residue ranges in the format suitable for copying into group input
 section of Amber input file.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The option 
\shape italic
-find
\shape default
 is followed by "maskstr" expression.
 This is a string where some characters have a special meaning and thus
 express what parts (atoms/residues) of the molecule will get selected.
 The syntax of this string is explained in the section above (DESCRIPTION).
 If this option is left out, it defaults to ":*", which selects all atoms
 in the given topology file.
 The length of "maskstr" is limited to 80 characters.
 If the "maskstr" contains spaces or special characters (which would be
 expanded by the shell), it should be protected by single or double quotes
 (depending on the shell).
 In addition, for C-shells even a quoted exclamation character may be expanded
 for history substitution.
 Thus, it is recommended that the operand of the negation operator always
 be enclosed in parentheses so that "!" is always followed by a "(" to produce
 "!(" which disables the special history interpretation.
 For example, [@C=
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

&
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

!(@CA,C)] selects all carbons except backbone alpha and carbonyl carbon;
 the parentheses are redundant but shell safe.
 The man page indicates further ways to disable history substitution.

\begin_layout Standard
Because all atom names are left justified in Amber topology and the selections
 are case insensitive, there is no way to distinguish some atom names: alpha
 carbon CA and a calcium ion Ca are a notorious example of that.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This section describes the format used to define groups of atoms in various
 Amber programs.
 In 
\shape italic
sander
\shape default
, a group can be specified as a movable "belly" while the other atoms are
 fixed absolutely in space (aside from scaling caused by constant pressure
 simulation), and/or a group of movable atoms can independently restrained
 (held by a potential) at their positions.
 In 
\shape italic
anal

, groups can be defined for energy analysis.
 In sander and pmemd, GROUP input comes at the end of the mdin input file,
 as discussed in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Except in the analysis module where different groups of atoms are considered
 with different group numbers for energy decomposition, in all other places
 the groups of atoms defined are considered as marked atoms to be included
 for certain types of calculations.
 In the case of constrained minimization or dynamics, the atoms to be constraine
d are read as groups with a different weight for each group.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Reading of groups is performed by the routine RGROUP, and you are advised
 to consult it if there is still some ambiguity in the documentation.

The "middle" scheme [Section

 There are many instances when standard molecular dynamics simulations get

 near the starting configuration, and fail to adequately sample the available
 low-energy configurational space.
 This chapter describes a variety of techniques that can partially overcome
 such problems.
 The following chapter (on Free Energies) continues many of these ideas,
 adapting them to the calculation of alchemical or configurational free
 energy differences.
 There is no good distinction between these two chapters, because good sampling
 of the canonical distribution and estimation of free energies go hand-in-hand.
 But the present chapter covers methods that are

Targeted MD
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The targeted MD option adds an additional term to the energy function based
 on the mass-weighted root mean square deviation of a set of atoms in the
 current structure compared to a reference structure.
 The reference structure is specified using the 
\shape italic
-ref
\shape default
 flag in the same manner as is used for Cartesian coordinate restraints
 (NTR=1).
 Targeted MD can be used with or without positional restraints.
 If positional restraints are not applied (ntr=0), 
\shape italic
sander
\shape default
 performs a best-fit of the reference structure to the simulation structure
 based on selection in 
\shape italic
tgtfitmask
\shape default
 and calculates the RMSD for the atoms selected by 
\shape italic
tgtrmsmask
\shape default
.
 The two masks can be identical or different.
 This way, fitting to one part of the structure but calculating the RMSD
 (and thus restraint force) for another part of the structure is possible.
 If targeted MD is used in conjunction with positional restraints (ntr=1),
 only 
\shape italic
tgtrmsmask
\shape default
 should be given in the control input because the molecule is 'fitted' implicitl
y by applying positional restraints to atoms specified in 
\shape italic
restraintmask
\shape default
.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 The energy term has the form:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
E = 0.5 * TGTMDFRC * NATTGTRMS * (RMSD-TGTRMSD)**2
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The energy will be added to the RESTRAINT term.
 Note that the energy is weighted by the number of atoms that were specified
 in the 
\shape italic
tgtrmsmask
\shape default
 (NATTGTRMS).
 The RMSD is the root mean square deviation and is mass weighted.
 The force constant is defined using the 
\shape italic
tgtmdfrc
\shape default
 variable (see below).
 This option can be used with molecular dynamics or minimization.
 When targeted MD is used, 
\shape italic
sander
\shape default
 will print the current values for the actual and target RMSD to the energy
 summary in the output file.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One can imagine many uses for this option, but a few things should be kept
 in mind.
 In this implementation of targeted MD, there is currently only one reference
 coordinate set, so there is no way to force the coordinates to any specific
 structure other than the one reference.
 To move a structure toward a reference coordinate set, one might use an
 initial 
\shape italic
tgtrmsd
\shape default
 value corresponding to the actual RMSD between the input and reference
 (
\shape italic
inpcrd
\shape default
 and 
\shape italic
refc
\shape default
).
 Then the weight change option could be used to decrease this value to 0
 during the simulation.
 To move a structure away from the reference, one can increase 
\shape italic
tgtrmsd
\shape default
 to values larger than zero.
 The minimum for this energy term will then be at structures with an RMSD
 value that matches 
\shape italic
tgtrmsd
\shape default
.
 Keep in mind that many different structures may have similar RMSD values
 to the reference, and therefore one cannot be sure that increasing 
\shape italic
tgtrmsd
\shape default
 to a given value will result in a particular structure that has that RMSD
 value.
 In this case it is probably wiser to use the final structure, rather than
 the initial structure, as the reference coordinate set, and decrease

 As an additional note, a negative force constant

Also keep in mind that phase space for molecular systems can be quite complex,
 and this method does not guarantee that a low energy path between initial
 and target structures will be followed.
 It is possible for the simulation to become unstable if the restraint energies
 become too large if a low-energy path between a simulated structure and
 the reference is not accessible.

Multiply-Targeted MD (MTMD)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In Amber (
\shape italic
sander only
\shape default
), the user may perform targeted MD calculations using multiple reference
 structures.
 Each reference may have its own associated target RMSD value and force
 constant, each of which can evolve independently in time.
 Additionally, the masks for each defined target may differ, and targeting
 to any given reference structure can be activated for some or part of the
 simulation.
 The energy term for MTMD is simply the sum of the energies that would be
 calculated for the molecule calculated relative to each target given the
 target RMSD and force constant for that target.
 The energy will then be added to the RESTRAINT term.

 The centerpiece of LMOD is a conformational search algorithm based on eigenvect
or following of low frequency vibrational modes.
 It has been applied to a spectrum of computational chemistry domains including
 protein loop optimization and flexible active site docking.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the Amber 2020 release, the LMOD optimization code has been updated with
 major improvements and new features including more accurate flexible docking,
 the option to visualize normal modes, utilization of random mixtures of
 low-frequency modes, and the option to work with a range of modes anywhere
 in the spectrum and not just the lowest frequency modes.
 The latter is particularly useful for docking where the modes relevant
 to binding a ligand molecule are usually not the lowest frequency modes.
  The interface of the new LMOD has not changed, everything works exactly
 the same way as in Amber18 and earlier versions, a few parameters simply
 have additional options as documented below.
 The new features are demonstrated with production quality examples.

dimension

\end_inset

 The dimension of the ARPACK Arnoldi factorization.
 Zero specifies the whole space, that is, three times the number of atoms.
 Default is 0, the whole space.
 Basically, the ARPACK package used for the eigenvector calculations solves
 multiple "small" eigenvalue problems instead of a single "large" problem,
 which is the diagonalization of the three times the number of atoms by
 three times the number of atoms Hessian matrix.
 This parameter is the user specified dimension of the "small" problem.
 The allowed range is total_low_modes + 1 
\begin_inset Formula $<$
\end_inset

= arnoldi_dimension 
\begin_inset Formula $<$
\end_inset

= three times the number of atoms.
 The default means that the "small" problem and the "large" problem are
 identical.
 This is the preferred, i.e., fastest, calculation for small to medium size
 systems, because ARPACK is guaranteed to converge in a single iteration.
 The ARPACK calculation scales with three times the number of atoms times
 the arnoldi_dimension squared and, therefore, for larger molecules there
 is an optimal arnoldi_dimension much less than three times the number of
 atoms that converges much faster in multiple iterations (possibly thousands
 or tens of thousands of iterations).
 The key to good performance is to select an arnoldi_dimension such that
 all the ARPACK storage fits in memory.
 For proteins, arnoldi_dimension=1000 is generally a good value, but often
 a very small 50-100 Arnoldi dimension provides the fastest net computational
 cost with very many iterations.

In a free energy calculation, the system evolves according to a mixed potential
 (such as in Eqs.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:linearmix"

\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:klambdamix"

, below).
 The essence of free energy calculations is to record and analyze the fluctuatio
ns in the values of 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{0}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{1}$
\end_inset

 (that is, what the energies 
\shape italic
would have been
\shape default
 with the endpoint potentials) as the simulation progresses.
 For thermodynamic integration (which is a very straightforward form of
 analysis) the required averages can be computed "on-the-fly" (as the simulation
 progresses), and printed at the end of a run.
 For more complex analyses (such as the Bennett acceptance ratio scheme),
 one needs to write the history of the values of 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{0}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{1}$
\end_inset

 to a file, and later post-process this file to obtain the final free energy
 estimates.
\end_layout

 Such calculations are demanding, both in terms of computer time, and in
 a level of sophistication to avoid pitfalls that can lead to poor convergence.
 Since there is no one "best way" to estimate free energies, 
\shape italic
sander
\shape default
 and 
\shape italic
pmemd
\shape default
 primarily provide the tools to collect the statistics that are needed.
 Assembling these into a final answer, and assessing the accuracy and significan
ce of the results, generally requires some calculations outside of what
 Amber provides, 
\shape italic
per se
\shape default
.
 The discussion here will assume a certain level of familiarity with the
 basis of free energy calculations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Both 
\shape italic
sander
\shape default
 and 
\shape italic

\shape default
 have the capability of doing simple thermodynamic free energy calculations,
 using either PME or generalized Born potentials.
 When 
\shape italic

\shape default
 is set to 1, information useful for doing thermodynamic integration estimates
 of free energy changes will be computed.
 The implementation is different between 
\shape italic
sander
\shape default
 and 
\shape italic
pmemd
\shape default
.
 For 
\shape italic
sander
\shape default

 capability to create two groups, one corresponding to the starting state,
 and a second corresponding to the ending state (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 for information); you will need a 
\shape italic
prmtop
\shape default
 file for each of these two endpoints.
 For 
\shape italic
pmemd
\shape default
, you use a single 
\shape italic

 For both 
\shape italic

\shape default
 and

 a mixing parameter

 is used to interpolate between the "unperturbed" and "perturbed" potential

\begin_layout Subsection

\series bold
Thermodynamic integration using Sander
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are now two different ways to prepare a thermodynamic integration
 free energy calculation in Sander.
 The first is unchanged from previous versions of Amber: Here, the two prmtop
 files that you create must have the same number of atoms, and the atoms
 must appear 
\shape italic
in the same order
\shape default
 in the two files.
 This is because there is only one set of coordinates that are propagated
 in the molecular dynamics algorithm.
 If there are more atoms in the initial state than in the final, "dummy"
 atoms must be introduced into the final state to make up the difference.
 Although there is quite a bit of flexibility in choosing the initial and
 final states, it is important in general that the system be able to morph
 "smoothly" from the initial to the final state.
 Alternatively, you can set up your system to use the softcore potential
 algorithm described below.
 This will remove the requirement to prepare "dummy" atoms and allows the
 two 
\shape italic
prmtop
\shape default
 files to have different numbers of atoms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The basics of the 
\emph on
multisander
\emph default
 functionality are given in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:multisander"

\end_inset

, but the mechanics are really quite simple.
 You start a free energy calculation as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\begin_inset Formula $<$
\end_inset

filename
\begin_inset Formula $>$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since there are 4 total cpu's in this example, each of the two groups will
 run in parallel with 2 cpu's each.
 The number of processors must be a multiple of two.
 The 
\shape italic
groups
\shape default
 file might look like this:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
-O -i mdin -p prmtop.0 -c eq1.x -o md1.o -r md1.x -inf mdinfo
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
-O -i mdin -p prmtop.1 -c eq1.x -o md1b.o -r md1b.x -inf mdinfob
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The input (
\shape italic
mdin
\shape default
) and starting coordinate files must be the same for the two groups.
 Furthermore, the two 
\shape italic
prmtop
\shape default
 files must have the same number number of atoms, in the same order (since
 one common set of coordinates will be used for both.) The simulation will
 use the masses found in the first 
\shape italic
prmtop
\shape default
 file; in classical statistical mechanics, the Boltzmann distribution in
 coordinates is independent of the masses so this should not represent any
 real restriction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On output, the two restart files should be identical, and the two output
 files should differ only in trivial ways such as timings; there should
 be no differences in any energy-related quantities, except if energy decomposit
ion is turned on (
\emph on
idecomp
\emph default
 > 0); then only the output file of the first group contains the per residue
 contributions to 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle \partial V/\partial\lambda\right\rangle $
\end_inset

.
 For our example, this means that one could delete the 
\shape italic
md1b.o
\shape default
 and 
\shape italic
md1b.x
\shape default
 files, since the information they contain is also in 
\shape italic
md1.o
\shape default
 and 
\shape italic
md1.x
\shape default
.
 (It is a good practice, however, to check these file identities, to make
 sure that nothing has gone wrong.)

 The frequency by which values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle \partial V/\partial\lambda\right\rangle $

Background theory of thermodynamic integration
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\emph on
sander and pmemd
\emph default
 programs do not compute free energies; it is up to the user to combine
 the output of several runs (at different values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

) and to numerically estimate the integral:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\Delta A=A(\lambda=1)-A(\lambda=0)=\int_{0}^{1}\left\langle \partial V/\partial\lambda\right\rangle _{\lambda}d\lambda\label{eq:ti}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you understand how free energies work, this should not be at all difficult.
 However, since the actual values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

that are needed, and the exact method of numerical integration, depend upon
 the problem and upon the precision desired, we have not tried to pre-code
 these into the program.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The simplest numerical integration is to evaluate the integrand at the midpoint:
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\Delta A\simeq\left\langle \partial V/\partial\lambda\right\rangle _{1/2}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This might be a good first thing to do to get some picture of what is going
 on, but is only expected to be accurate for very smooth or small changes,
 such as changing just the charges on some atoms.
 Gaussian quadrature formulas of higher order are generally more useful:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\Delta A=\sum_{i}w_{i}\left\langle \partial V/\partial\lambda\right\rangle _{i}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some weights and quadrature points are given in the accompanying table;
 other formulas are possible,
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Hummer96"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 but the Gaussian ones listed there are probably the most useful.
 The formulas are always symmetrical about 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

= 0.5, so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $(1-\lambda)$
\end_inset

 both have the same weight.
 For example, if you wanted to use 5-point quadrature, you would need to
 run five jobs, setting 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

to 0.04691, 0.23076, 0.5, 0.76923, and 0.95308 in turn.
 (Each value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 should have an equilibration period as well as a sampling period; this
 can be achieved by setting the 
\shape italic
ntave
\shape default
 parameter.) You would then multiply the values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle \partial V/\partial\lambda\right\rangle _{i}$
\end_inset

 by the weights listed in the Table, and compute the sum.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When 
\shape italic
icfe=1
\shape default
 and 
\shape italic
klambda
\shape default
 has its default value of 1, the simulation uses the mixed potential function:
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
V(\lambda)=(1-\lambda)V_{0}+\lambda V_{1}\label{eq:linearmix}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{0}$
\end_inset

 is the potential with the original Hamiltonian, and 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{1}$
\end_inset

 is the potential with the perturbed Hamiltonian.
 The program also computes and prints 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle \partial V/\partial\lambda\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 and its averages; note that in this case, 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle \partial V/\partial\lambda\right\rangle =V_{1}-V_{0}$
\end_inset

.
 This is referred to as linear mixing, and is often what you want unless
 you are making atoms appear or disappear.
 If some of the perturbed atoms are "dummy" atoms (with no van der Waals
 terms, so that you are making these atoms "disappear" in the perturbed
 state), the integrand in Eq.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:ti"

\end_inset

 diverges at 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

= 1; this is a mild enough divergence that the overall integral remains
 finite, but it still requires special numerical integration techniques
 to obtain a good estimate of the integral.

\end_layout

\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_inset Formula $k$

 Note that this reduces to Eq.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 when 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 = 1, which is the default.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $k\geq$
\end_inset

4, the integrand remains finite as 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda\rightarrow1$
\end_inset

.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 We have found that setting 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

= 6 with disappearing groups as large as tryptophan works, but using the
 softcore option (

\begin_inset Formula $>$
\end_inset

0) instead is generally preferred.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 Note that the behavior of 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle \partial V/\partial\lambda\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 as a function of 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 is not monotonic when 
\shape italic
klambda
\shape default
 
\begin_inset Formula $>$
\end_inset

 1.
 You may need a fairly fine quadrature to get converged results for the
 integral, and you may want to sample more carefully in regions where 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle \partial V/\partial\lambda\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 is changing rapidly.

This is implemented in

 by calling the force() routine independently for each

 For a fixed number of processors this increases the cost of the calculation
 compared with the

Eq.

 is designed for having dummy atoms in the perturbed Hamiltonian, and "real"
 atoms in the regular Hamiltonian.
 You must ensure that this is the case when you set up the system in LEaP.
 (See the softcore section, below, for a more general way to handle disappearing
 atoms, which does not require dummy atoms at all.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
One common application of this model is to pKa calculations, where the charges
 are mutated from the protonated to the deprotonated form.
 Since H atoms bonded to oxygen already have zero van der Waals radii (in
 the Amber force fields and in TIP3P water), once their charge is removed
 (in the deprotonated form) they are really then like dummy atoms.
 For this special situation, there is no need to use 
\shape italic
klambda
\shape default
 
\begin_inset Formula $>$
\end_inset

 1: since the van der Waals terms are missing from both the perturbed and
 unperturbed states, the proton's position can never lead to the large contribut
ions to 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle \partial V/\partial\lambda\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 that can occur when one is changing from a zero van der Waals term to a
 finite one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The implementation requires that the masses of all atoms be the same on
 all threads.
 To enforce this, the masses found for 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{0}$
\end_inset

 are used for 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{1}$
\end_inset

 as well.
 In classical statistical mechanics, the canonical distribution of configuration
s (and hence of potential energies) is unaffected by changes in the masses,
 so this should not pose a limitation.
 Since the masses for 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{1}$
\end_inset

 are ignored, they do not have to match those found for 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{0}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Special care needs to be taken when using SHAKE for atoms whose force field
 parameters differ in the two end points.
 The same bonds must be SHAKEN in both cases, and the equilibrium bond lengths
 must also be the same.
 By default, the coordinates from 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{0}$
\end_inset

 are synchronized with those from 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{1}$
\end_inset

 after SHAKE.
 This will work for small perturbations, but if there is a significant change
 in bond length, it may be necessary to use the 
\shape italic

\begin_inset Index idx

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\shape italic
\emph on

\end_layout

\end_inset


\shape default
 input to remove SHAKE from the regions that are being perturbed.
 If this is done, be sure to set

tishake
\begin_inset Index idx

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\shape italic
\emph on

\end_layout

\end_inset


\shape default
=1 and to use a 1 fs timestep.
 Special care needs to be taken when water molecules are part of the region
 that is changing.
 You need to make sure that the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

number of 3-point waters
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is the same in both 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{0}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 This may require setting 
\emph on
jfastw
\emph default
 and/or building the structure so that 
\emph on
sander or pmemd
\emph default
 do not think that the water molecules involved are actually rigid waters.
 Also, just setting 
\emph on
noshakemask
\emph default
 might not be enough, since this flag does not affect the 
\emph on
settle
\emph default
 routine that handles rigid waters.

Softcore Potentials in Thermodynamic Integration
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Softcore potentials provide an additional way to perform thermodynamic integrati
on calculations in Amber.
 The system setup has been simplified so that appearing and disappearing
 atoms can be present at the same time and no dummy atoms need to be introduced.
 For 
\shape italic
sander
\shape default
, two prmtop files, corresponding to the start and end states (
\begin_inset Formula $V_{0}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{1}$
\end_inset

) of the desired transformation need to be used.
 The common atoms that are present in both states need to appear in the
 same order in both prmtop files and must have identical starting positions.
 In addition to the common atoms, each process can have any number of unique
 soft core atoms, as specified by scmask.
 For 
\shape italic
pmemd
\shape default
, a single prmtop file is used, containing the unique atoms for both the
 start and end states.
 The soft core atoms are specified by scmask1 and scmask2 for 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{0}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{1}$
\end_inset

 respectively.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A modified version of the vdW equation is used to smoothly switch off non-bonded
 interactions of these atoms with their common atom neighbors:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
V_{V_{0,}disappearing}=4\epsilon(1-\lambda)\left[\frac{1}{\left[\alpha\lambda+\left(\frac{r_{ij}}{\sigma}\right)^{6}\right]^{2}}-\frac{1}{\alpha\lambda+(\frac{r_{ij}}{\sigma})^{6}}\right]\label{eq:softcoreV0}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
V_{V_{1},appearing}=4\epsilon\lambda\left[\frac{1}{\left[\alpha(1-\lambda)+\left(\frac{r_{ij}}{\sigma}\right)^{6}\right]^{2}}-\frac{1}{\alpha(1-\lambda)+(\frac{r_{ij}}{\sigma})^{6}}\right]\label{eq:softcoreV1}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Please refer to Ref 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Steinbrecher07"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 for a description of the implementation and performance testing when compared
 to the TI methods described above using 
\shape italic
sander
\shape default
.
 For similar information pertaining to pmemd please see Ref 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Kaus13"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 Note that the term 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

disappearing
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is used here, but it would probably be better to say that atoms present
 in 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{0}$
\end_inset

 but not in 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{1}$
\end_inset

 are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

decoupled
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 from their environment: the interactions among the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

disappearing
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 atoms are not changed, and do not contribute to 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle \partial V/\partial\lambda\right\rangle $
\end_inset

.
 If the disappearing atoms are a separate molecule (say a non-covalently-bound
 ligand), this can be viewed as a transfer to the gas-phase.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that a slightly different setup is required for using soft core potentials
 compared to older TI-implementations.
 Specifically, the difference is that to add or remove atoms without soft
 core potentials, they are transformed into interactionless dummy particles,
 so both end state prmtop files have the same number of atoms.
 When using soft core potentials instead, no dummy atoms are needed and
 the end states should be built without them.
 Therefore prmtop files for non soft core simulations may have to be adapted
 to be used with soft core potentials and vice versa.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All bonded interactions of the unique atoms are recorded separately in the
 output file (see below).
 Any bond, angle, dihedral or 1-4 term that involves at least one appearing
 or disappearing atom is not scaled by 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 and does not contribute to 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle \partial V/\partial\lambda\right\rangle $
\end_inset

.
 Therefore, output from both processes will not be identical when soft core
 potentials are used.
 Softcore transformations avoid the origin singularity effect and therefore
 linear mixing can (and should) always be used with them.
 Since the unique atoms become decoupled from their surroundings at high
 or low lambdas and energy exchange between them and surrounding solvent
 becomes inefficient, a Berendsen type thermostat should not be used for
 SC calculations.
 Unlike in previous versions, SHAKE constraints are not automatically removed
 from bonds between common and unique atoms.
 Instead, the coordinates corresponding to common atoms in 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{0}$
\end_inset

are synchronized with those of 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{1}$
\end_inset

.

 The icfe and klambda parameters should be set to 1 for a soft core run
 and the desired lambda value will be specified by clambda.
 When using softcore potentials with 
\shape italic
sander
\shape default
, 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 values should be picked so that 0.01 < clambda < 0.99.
 The 
\shape italic

\shape default
 implementation allows lambda to be set to any value between 0.0 and 1.0,
 thus simulations at the endpoints are possible.

\begin_inset Formula $12\textrm{A}^{2}$
\end_inset

, other values have not been extensively tested.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With the use of soft core vdW and electrostatics interactions, arbitrary
 changes between systems are possible in single TI calculations.
 However, due to the unusual potential function forms introduced, it is

 All these methods estimate the free energy of a reaction coordinate from
 an evolving ensemble of realizations, and use that estimate to bias the
 system dynamics to flatten an effective free energy surface.
 Collectively, these methods may all be considered to be umbrella sampling

 It is characterized by a favorable scaling in time, and only a few (two)
 control parameters.
 It is formulated in terms of the following equations: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[

\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{\partial U(t|\xi)}{\partial t}=\frac{k_{B}T}{\tau_{F}}G\big[\xi-\sigma\left(\mathbf{r}_{1},\dots,\mathbf{r}_{N}\right)\big],
\]

\end_inset

 where the first equation represents Newton's law that governs ordinary

 an additional force coming from the time dependent biasing potential 
\begin_inset Formula $U(t|\xi)$

\end_inset

], whose time evolution is given by the second equation.
 
\begin_inset Formula $G(\xi)$
\end_inset

 is a positive definite and symmetric kernel, which may be thought of as
 a smoothed Dirac delta function.
 For large enough 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{F}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $U(t|\xi)$
\end_inset

 converges towards 
\begin_inset Formula $-f(\xi)$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $t\to\infty$

In order to assess and improve the accuracy of the free energies, the

 accumulations may need to be followed up with equilibrium umbrella sampling
 runs, which make use of the biasing potential 
\begin_inset Formula $U(t|\xi)$
\end_inset

 as is.
 Such a procedure is very much in the spirit of adaptive umbrella sampling.
 With these runs, one calculates the biased probability density: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p^{B}(\xi)=\big<\delta\left[\xi-\sigma(\mathbf{r}_{1},\dots,\mathbf{r}_{N})\right]\big>_{B}.
\]

\end_inset

 The idea here is that if, as a result of an

 run, 
\begin_inset Formula $f(\xi)+U(t|\xi)=0$

 exactly, then the biased probability density

 would be flat (constant).
 In practice, this is typically not the case, but one can use

 In the original ABMD implementation, the history dependent biasing potential
 is built up at a fixed rate: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
U(\xi,t)=U^{0}(\xi)+\int_{0}^{t}dt^{\prime}\,\omega\,G(\xi-\xi^{t^{\prime}}),\label{eq:abmd}

\begin_inset Formula $U(\xi,t)$
\end_inset

 is the biasing potential at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $U^{0}$
\end_inset

 is an arbitrary function that typically represents the initial guess for
 the biasing potential (in the absence of a guess, this is assumed to be
 flat) and 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega=k_{B}T/\tau_{F}$
\end_inset

 is a constant, unbiased rate.
 As the simulation proceeds and reaches convergence, then 
\begin_inset Formula $\big<U(\xi,t\rightarrow\infty)\big>_{a}\approx U^{s}(\xi)+u(t)$
\end_inset

, in which 
\begin_inset Formula $\big<.\big>_{a}$
\end_inset

 is the ensemble-average over the adaptive trajectories, the stationary
 term is 
\begin_inset Formula $U^{s}\approx-F(\xi)$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $u(t)$
\end_inset

 is an additive time-dependent constant 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Barducci_A_08"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 Unfortunately, updating the biasing potential at the same rate throughout
 the simulation may lead to a poorly converged result, since the biasing
 potential ends up fluctuating around 
\begin_inset Formula $-F(\xi)$
\end_inset

 with an amplitude that depends on 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One way to resolve this problem is to update the kernel at a non-uniform
 rate by means of a "well-tempered" 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
U(\xi,t)=U^{0}(\xi)+\int_{0}^{t}dt^{\prime}\,\omega(\xi^{t^{\prime}},t^{\prime})\,G(\xi-\xi^{t^{\prime}}),\label{eq:wtabmd}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

in which 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega(\xi,t)$
\end_inset

 is a time-dependent, non-uniform rate chosen to be 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{0}\,\mathrm{e}^{-\beta^{\prime}U(\xi,t)}$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $1/\beta^{\prime}=k_{B}T^{\prime}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $T^{\prime}$
\end_inset

 is a pseudo-temperature) that reduces to a constant 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{0}$
\end_inset

 in the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta^{\prime}\rightarrow0$
\end_inset

 limit (
\shape italic
i.e.
\shape default
, resulting in conventional ABMD).
 With this choice, one can show that 
\begin_inset Formula $\big<U(\xi,t\rightarrow\infty)\big>_{a}\approx U^{s}(\xi)+u(t)$
\end_inset

, (
\begin_inset Formula $u(t)$
\end_inset

 is an additive constant) in which 
\begin_inset Formula $U^{s}(\xi)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $F(\xi)$
\end_inset

 are related via 
\begin_inset Formula $U^{s}(\xi)=-(1+\frac{\beta^{\prime}}{\beta})^{-1}F(\xi)$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $F(\xi)=-(1+\frac{T}{T^{\prime}})U^{s}(\xi)$
\end_inset

 This way of updating the biasing potential leads to a considerably smoother
 convergence to the desired free energy and more stable ABMD simulations.

Multiple walker selection algorithm:
\series default
 The ABMD multiple walker algorithm can be improved by allowing for periodic
 interactions between the different walkers and "resampling" on-the-fly.
 The rationale behind this is that not all walkers are equally effective
 in sampling the configuration space.
 A situation that is all too common is that different walkers end up being
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

bunched up" or clustered together in some local metastable region, because
 of hidden barriers that are oriented along orthogonal degrees of freedom
 to the reaction coordinate.
 To improve this situation, one would like to facilitate walkers that are
 sampling the undersampled regions of phase space, and force the walkers
 in the oversampled regions to move away and explore regions not yet covered.
 Such an algorithm has previously been implemented via scripts in the NAMD
 code for the adaptive biasing force algorithm

A resampling or selection algorithms for interacting multiple walkers requires
 a continual monitoring of the walkers by means of a periodic evaluation
 of a fitness function and a resampling of the walkers according to their
 fitness efficiency
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Minoukadeh_K_10"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 Efficient walkers that are wandering in the undersampled regions are enhanced
 by being cloned, while inefficient walkers found in the oversampled regions
 of phase space are correspondingly killed.
 This procedure is then repeated periodically during the simulation, thereby
 accelerating convergence to a more uniform distribution of walkers and
 flattening of the free energy landscape.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our specific interacting/resampling/selection multiple-walker algorithm
 is implemented as follows.
 Each walker 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 is assigned a weight 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{n}$
\end_inset

, which is evaluated at the end of each resampling period of time 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

.
 At the 
\begin_inset Formula $i^{th}$
\end_inset

 resampling period, i.e., from time 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{(i-1)}=(i-1)\tau$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{i}=i\tau$
\end_inset

, walker 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 moves through configuration space building up its own trajectory 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(r_{1}^{n},\dots,r_{N}^{n}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 The weights are then tested and updated every fixed time interval of length
 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

.
 Specifically, after the 
\begin_inset Formula $i^{th}$
\end_inset

 time interval, weights are estimated by: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
w_{n}=K^{-1}\exp\bigg(\int_{t_{i-1}}^{t_{i}}S(\xi_{n}^{t})dt\bigg),
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi_{n}^{t}$
\end_inset

 represents the collective variable evaluated at time t for trajectory 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $K=\sum_{n=1}^{N_{w}}w_{n}$
\end_inset

 is the normalization factor, and 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
S(\xi)=C\nabla^{2}(\rho(\xi))/\rho(\xi),
\]

\end_inset

with 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho(\xi)$
\end_inset

 representing the density of microstates in the collective variable space
 and 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 a constant.
 The quantity 
\begin_inset Formula $S(\xi)$
\end_inset

 will be positive typically if the walker is found in the undersampled regions,
 which have a convex density function.
 Similarly, a negative 
\begin_inset Formula $S(\xi)$
\end_inset

 value indicates that the system is in the concave region of the density
 function, which typically is oversampled.
 In the context of ABMD implementation, the biasing potential is approximately
 proportional to the histogram of the collective variable by construction,
 and represents a good estimate for 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

.
 The implementation is therefore straightforward; the integral above is
 estimated for each trajectory independently by summing over

 The number of copies present in the next period for walker

\begin_inset Formula $0<\eta_{n}<1$

 The atomic coordinates and velocities of the walkers with 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{n}>0$
\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In terms of an ABMD simulation, the selection algorithm is most beneficial
 during the initial and middle parts of the simulation when there are large
 variations in the biasing potential.
 In the latter parts, when the effective free energy is almost flat, the
 distribution of walkers should be roughly uniform.
 In that case, the selection mechanism is unnecessary and, if one wishes
 to continue the simulation, it is best to proceed with the non interacting
 multiple walker algorithm.
 It has been found that a convenient stopping mechanism may be based on
 the entropy of the weights.
 Defining 
\begin_inset Formula $H=\sum_{n}w_{n}log(w_{n})$
\end_inset

, the selection mechanism will be stopped if 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{w}=H-log(1/N_{w})$
\end_inset

 goes below -
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon log(1/N_{w})$
\end_inset

.
 Here, 
\begin_inset Formula $log(1/N_{w})$
\end_inset

 represents the entropy of uniform weights, and the stopping parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon$
\end_inset

 varies between 
\begin_inset Formula $0\leq\epsilon\leq1$
\end_inset

.
 When 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon=0$
\end_inset

, the algorithm never stops, while 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon=1$
\end_inset

 forces a stop irrespective of the values of the weights.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition to 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon$
\end_inset

, there are also two other user-defined variables in the selection algorithm,
 including the constant 
\shape italic
C
\shape default
 and the interval time 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

.
 While the physical interpretation of 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 is straightforward, 
\shape italic
C
\shape default
 represents a pseudo diffusion constant.
 One may think of the selection algorithm as an induced diffusion in the
 reaction coordinate space; The larger the value of 
\shape italic
C
\shape default
, the faster the system will diffuse along the reaction coordinate space.
 Therefore 
\shape italic
C
\shape default
 determines the strength or aggressiveness of the resampling algorithm.
 The most efficient value for 
\shape italic
C
\shape default
 is dependent on the nature of the collective variable and the shape of
 its density 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

.
 Since the best choice of 
\shape italic
C
\shape default
 for a given problem is somewhat of an art, we refer the interested reader
 to the ABMD tutorials on the AMBER webpage for insight into choosing this
 variable.
 Finally, we also note that the multiple walker selection mechanism can
 be invoked as is or in conjunction with the WT-ABMD for enhanced stability
 and convergence.

\series bold
Driven ABMD: 
\series default
ABMD and SMD schemes are both powerful nonequilibrium sampling methods;
 however, each comes with its own practical limitations.
 For instance, SMD is often associated with a very slow convergence if used
 for free energy calculations.
 However it can be used to explore the transition paths, at least qualitatively;
 an advantage over ABMD, in which the system starting from one end of the
 configuration space (the reactant) may take a long time to visit the other
 end (the product).
 SMD and ABMD schemes, however can be integrated into a novel driven adaptive-bi
as 3 scheme, termed driven ABMD (D-ABMD) that takes advantage of both its
 driven and adaptive-bias components and is advantageous over both components
 in isolation.
 D-ABMD has an advantage over conventional (or well-tempered) ABMD in that
 it ensures the exploration of the transition pathway (from one end to the
 other) in the early stages of the simulation and gradually improves the
 estimate of the free energies almost uniformly along the reaction coordinate.
 D-ABMD has also an advantage over the conventional SMD in that the effective
 free energy surface gradually becomes smooth and flat such that the system
 can move along the reaction coordinate with progressively less amount of
 work.
 The D-ABMD method is similar to D-MetaD method, which was recently introduced
 in Ref.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 as an example of driven, adaptive-bias schemes.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to combine the two schemes described above, we have developed a
 driven adaptive-bias scheme that adds an adaptive 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{a}(\xi,t)$
\end_inset

 and a driving 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{d}(\xi,t)$
\end_inset

 potential to the Hamiltonian.
 We use an iterative approach in which an independent simulation is performed
 from time t = 0 to t = T in the 
\begin_inset Formula $n^{th}$
\end_inset

 iteration (n = 1, 2, .
 .
 .), biased by the potential 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{d}(\xi,t)+U_{a}^{n}(\xi,t)$
\end_inset

 in which 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{d}(\xi,t)=\frac{k}{2}(\xi-\eta(t))^{2}$
\end_inset

 for all n (
\begin_inset Formula $\eta(t)$
\end_inset

 is moving center of the SMD harmonic potential in the 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi$
\end_inset

 space), and:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
U_{a}^{n}(\xi,t)=U^{n-1}(\xi)+\int_{0}^{t}dt'\omega(\xi^{t'},t')K(\xi-\xi^{t'})e^{-\beta\omega^{t'}}
\]

\end_inset

in which 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega^{t}$
\end_inset

 is either defined as the accumulated work or the transferred work.
 The accumulated and transferred works are defined as 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{ac}^{t}=\intop_{0}^{t}dt'\,\frac{\partial}{\partial t'}U_{d}(\xi^{t'},t')$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{tr}^{t}=\omega_{ac}^{t}-U_{d}(\xi^{t},t)$
\end_inset

.
 Theoretically the 
\begin_inset Formula $e^{-\beta\omega_{tr}^{t'}}$
\end_inset

 factor or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

constant weight‚Äù is more accurate but for practical reasons the 
\begin_inset Formula $e^{-\beta\omega_{ac}^{t'}}$
\end_inset

 factor or ‚Äúpulling wight‚Äù is preferred.
 Particularly, in our algorithm, the constant weight 
\begin_inset Formula $e^{-\beta\omega_{tr}^{t'}}=e^{-\beta\omega_{ac}^{t'}}e^{\beta U_{d}(\xi^{t'},t')}$
\end_inset

 may become instable for large biasing potentials.
 To avoid the instability in either case a cutoff for 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega^{t}$
\end_inset

 is used (i.e., the algorithm will not be applied if 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega^{t}$
\end_inset

 is smaller than the cutoff).
 At the moment, Driven ABMD is only applicable to one-dimensional reaction
 coordinate.

 The

 separating different groups.
 The elements of the

; then followed by the reference coordinates of the atoms of the second
 group, followed by the second

 To make the presentation clearer, let us consider the example presented
 in Fig.

\begin_layout Description
QUATERNIONS: Describing large-scale atomistic conformational changes in
 biomolecular systems requires one to deal with orientational changes of
 atomistic domains with large numbers of atoms.
 While there are several ways of defining a collective variable that quantifies
 an orientation based conformational change, the orientation quaternion
 technique
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Coutsias, Fiorin, Moradi_M_15a, Moradi_M_15b"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 has proven successful as a well-behaved, flexible method for defining system-sp
ecific CVs, specifically aimed at inducing interdomain orientational changes
 or restraining the orientation of certain domains.
 The CVs in the orientation quaternion class, are all derived from an `optimal
 rotation' between a set of reference coordinates 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{X}_{k}$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $1\leq k\leq N$
\end_inset

; where 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 is the number of atoms involved) and the set of target coordinates 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{Y}_{k}$
\end_inset

.
 A `quaternion' is introduced as a four-component vector that can be expressed
 as 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{0}+q_{1}\hat{i}+q_{2}\hat{j}+q_{3}\hat{k}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{0}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{1}\hat{i}+q_{2}\hat{j}+q_{3}\hat{k}$
\end_inset

 are called scalar and vector parts respectively.
 The optimal rotation can be parametrized
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Assuming both sets have been already shifted to bring their barycenters
 to the origin (optimum translation).
\end_layout

\end_inset

 by a unit quaternion, 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{q}=(q_{0},q_{1},q_{2},q_{3})$
\end_inset

, that minimize 
\begin_inset Formula $<||\hat{q}\mathbf{X}_{k}\hat{q}^{*}-\mathbf{Y}_{k}||^{2}>$
\end_inset

 in which 
\begin_inset Formula $<.>$
\end_inset

 denotes an average over 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula $q^{*}$
\end_inset

 is the conjugate of 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $||q||^{2}=q^{*}q$
\end_inset

 (see Ref.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Coutsias"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 for more details).
 The optimal rotation unit quaternion (or orientation quaternion)
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{q}$
\end_inset

 can be written as 
\begin_inset Formula $\big(cos(\theta/2),sin(\theta/2)\hat{u}\big)$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 is the optimal rotation angle and 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{u}$
\end_inset

 is a unit vector associated with the optimal axis of rotation.
 To deal with large atomistic conformational changes, a set of quaternion-based
 CVs has implemented in AMBER20.
 For the details of usage, send emails to Ashkan Fakharzadeh (afakhar@ncsu.edu),
 Dr.
 Feng Pan (fpan3@ncsu.edu),  and Prof.
 Mahmoud Moradi (moradi@uark.edu).
 The specific quaternion-based CVs implemented are: ORIENTATION_ANGLE, ORIENTATI
ON_PROJ, TILT, SPINANGLE, QUATERNION0, QUATERNION1, QUATERNION2, and QUATERNION3.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

 These define the orientation of several atoms with respect to a set of
 reference coordinates in terms of a unit quaternion vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{q}=(q_{0},q_{1},q_{2},q_{3})$
\end_inset

 according to the method introduced in Ref.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Coutsias, Fiorin"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 These variables return the best-fit rotation, also used in best-fit RMSD
 calculation procedures, to superimpose the coordinates 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{X}$
\end_inset

 onto a set of reference coordinates 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{X}_{0}$
\end_inset

.
 The unit quaternion 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{q}=(q_{0},q_{1},q_{2},q_{3})$
\end_inset

 can be written as 
\begin_inset Formula $\big(cos(\theta/2),sin(\theta/2)\hat{u}\big)$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 is the rotation angle and 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{u}$
\end_inset

 is a unit vector associated with the axis of rotation; for example, a rotation
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $90^{\circ}$
\end_inset

 around the z axis 
\begin_inset Formula $(0,0,1)$
\end_inset

 is expressed as
\begin_inset Formula $(cos(90^{\circ}/2),0.0,0.0,sin(90^{\circ}/2))=(\sqrt{2}/2,0,0,\sqrt{2}/2)$
\end_inset

.
 The components of the unit quaternion 
\begin_inset Formula $(q_{0},q_{1},q_{2},q_{3})$
\end_inset

 were implemented separately as QUATERNION0, QUATERNION1, QUATERNION2, and
 QUATERNION3 CVs.
 To find the orientation, all four CVs QUATERNION0,...,QUATERNION3 are being
 used.
 To calculate the quaternion CVs one needs to specify a list of participating
 atoms and also their reference coordinates.
 The reference coordinates may be passed to AMBER either via direct specificatio
n inside the CV call, or by passing the name of a reference coordinates
 file.
 It is recommended that if the set of participating atoms is small (say
 no larger than 15), then these are specified directly inside the CV call.
 Otherwise, the passing of information via filename is recommended since
 these lists may contain hundreds if not thousands of atoms.
 Relevant parameters pertaining to the input of this information are: 
\begin_inset Formula $cv\_ni$
\end_inset

 represents the number of participating atoms; 
\begin_inset Formula $cv\_i$
\end_inset

 represents the list of the indices of all participating atoms; 
\begin_inset Formula $cv\_r$
\end_inset

 represents the reference coordinates (when passed directly) and 
\begin_inset Formula $refcrd\_file$
\end_inset

 is the filename for the reference coordinates when they are to be read
 from file.
 The file 
\begin_inset Formula $refcrd\_file$
\end_inset

 should be an AMBER coordinates/restart file containing coordinates, velocities,
 etc.
 of all atoms.
 The list participating atoms, 
\begin_inset Formula $cv\_i$
\end_inset

, and their reference coordinates (
\begin_inset Formula $cv\_r$
\end_inset

 and or 
\begin_inset Formula $refcrd\_file$
\end_inset

 ) must be the same for all QUATERNION0,...,QUATERNION3.
 The CVs are linked together using an attribute
\emph on
`q_index'
\emph default
.
 The
\emph on
`q_index'
\emph default
 accepts an integer between 
\begin_inset Formula $1,...,100$
\end_inset

, where its default value is one.

\begin_layout Description

\series bold
TILT:
\series default
 Cosine of the rotation orthogonal to an unit given axis.
 The tilt angle 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

, shows a rotation away from the direction 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{\hat{e}}$
\end_inset

.
 The tilt combined with the `spin' sub-rotation provides the complete orientatio
n rotation of a group of atoms.
 Similar to ORIENTATION_PROJ, to avoid the discontinuity around 
\begin_inset Formula $0^{\circ}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $180^{\circ}$
\end_inset

, the cosine of the tilt is implemented instead of the tilt angle itself,
 so that derivatives are continuous almost everywhere.
 The 
\begin_inset Formula $cv\_i$
\end_inset

 and 
\emph on
`axis'
\emph default
 are the participating atoms with indexes and the given axis, respectively.
 The reference coordinates are specified either via 
\begin_inset Formula $cv\_r$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $refcrd\_file$
\end_inset

.
 The value of TILT is between 
\begin_inset Formula $-1$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

, where the value 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 represents an orientation fully parallel to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{\hat{e}}$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $\omega=0^{\circ}$
\end_inset

), and the value 
\begin_inset Formula $-1$
\end_inset

 represents an anti-parallel orientation.

 to 3.
 In this case, both 
\family typewriter

 Even the number and type of reaction coordinate(s) could vary for different

\family typewriter
MDIN

 The

 The region of interest of the reaction coordinate is specified to be between

 The lower bound (-1 √Ö) could have been omitted for

 at the beginning of the run.
 The biasing potential built in the course of simulation will be saved to
 the same file (
\family typewriter

 The selection algorithm is used with the frequency of selection defined
 as 10000 MD steps and selection constant defined as 0.001.
 The well-tempered algorithm is also used, with the pseudo-temperature defined

 The

 This module is outdated since

 To applying

 The

\family default
 flavor (except that the namelist is changed from 
\family typewriter

\family default
 to 
\family typewriter

 Each

Swarms-of-Trajectories String Method
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
ABMD is a robust method for calculating free energy landscapes as a function
 of a small number of collective variables.
 Since the required computer time grows enormously with the number of collective
 variables, ABMD is best for exploring one- or two-dimensional phase spaces.
 However, rather than calculating full n-dimensional free energy maps, it
 is often fruitful to focus on the so-called Minimum Free Energy Path (MFEP)
 which the system is likely to take when transitioning between two minima.
 Calculating a MFEP in a complicated phase space is often difficult, and
 so-called ''string methods"

\end_inset

 represent one of the best approaches for finding the MFEP.
 Since sampling in string methods is essentially limited to regions around
 the MFEP, the cost of the method scales linearly with the length of the
 string or path, but only weakly on the number of collective variables.
 This results in considerable computational savings since the full free
 energy landscape is not calculated.

is one of the most popular versions of the string method and has been implemente
d here by Dr.
 Moradi (moradi@uark.edu).
 The module is available in both SANDER and PMEMD from Amber18 onwards.
 It is a path-finding algorithm that refines a putative transition pathway
 iteratively until the path is deemed to have been converged.
 The string is defined by a number of nodes or images parameterized in a
 high-dimensional space of collective variables, whose position is updated
 iteratively.
 The center of each image is first used as a restraining center to generate
 representative conformations at the current center before allowing of a
 small change in this center for the next iteration.
 The change in the center of each image is estimated by averaging over the
 drifts of a swarm of short unbiased trajectories all starting at the current
 image position (generated using the constrained simulations.
 Thus, each iteration consists of a series of restrained and free simulations.
 In the current serial version of the code, these simulations are performed
 independently.
 In parallel versions -- which are more efficient -- a very large number
 of replicas is required which are run in parallel; this method is particularly
 efficient on large supercomputers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To invoke the swarms-of-trajectories string method, the 
\family typewriter
&stsm
\family default
 must be invoked in the 
\family typewriter
MDIN
\family default
 file.
 For a string consisting of 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{s}$
\end_inset

 nodes each requiring 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 copies 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{s}\times M$
\end_inset

 replicas will be required.
 The parallel implemention of the STSM method is based on iterative restrained
 and free MD simulations followed by a reparametrization of the image centers
 defined in a multidimensional collective variable space 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi$
\end_inset

.
 For the 
\begin_inset Formula $i^{th}$
\end_inset

 iteration, first 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 copies of the 
\begin_inset Formula $n^{th}$
\end_inset

 image are generated around the old center 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi_{n}^{i-1}$
\end_inset

 by MD equilibration lasting 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{E}$
\end_inset

 timesteps.
 The generated 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 copies of the 
\begin_inset Formula $n^{th}$
\end_inset

 image are expected to be close to 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi_{n}^{i-1}$
\end_inset

 for time 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{E}$
\end_inset

, assuming that the invoked harmonic constant 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 for the restraining potential is large enough.
 The parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{E}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 thus need to be appropriately chosen in order to ensure that all copies
 of each image will be close to the image center.
 The restraint is then released, and each copy (swarm) is allowed to drift
 for 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{R}$
\end_inset

 timesteps.
 The newly shifted center 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi_{n}^{i}$
\end_inset

 for the 
\begin_inset Formula $n^{th}$
\end_inset

 image is then determined by averaging over all drifted copies 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi_{n,m}^{t}$
\end_inset

 at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t=\tau_{E}+\tau_{R}$
\end_inset

.
 The resulting string of images is then smoothed using a linear interpolation
 protocol.
 A smoothing parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $0\leq\epsilon\leq1$
\end_inset

 determines the smoothness of the curve; it is recommended that 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon$
\end_inset

 be of the order of 
\begin_inset Formula $1/(N_{s}-1)$
\end_inset

.
 The last setep is a reparameterization, which gain follows a linear interpolati
on protocol in order to generate 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{s}$
\end_inset

 equidistant centers along the string.
 The two key parameters of the method are 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{R}$
\end_inset

.
 Generally, the large the 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 and the shorter 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{R}$
\end_inset

, the smoother (but slower) the evolution of the MFEP will be.
 These variables must be optimized empirically, but typically 10 - 30 copies
 and 5 - 20 ps are reasonable values.
 It is often advantageous to set 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{E}$
\end_inset

 = 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{R}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An improved sequential repeat version of the algorithm has also been implemented
, which avoids the large number of copies and does not require a large number
 of processors to run.
 Here a new variable 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{R}$
\end_inset

 is introduced, as the number of repeat runs for each replica.
 Now for each copy, it will run around the old center 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi_{n}^{i-1}$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{R}$
\end_inset

 times sequentially.
 And each repeat run can be equally considered as a parallel run of a new
 copy around the old center.
 Namely, the new shifted center will be determined by averaging on 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{R}\times M$
\end_inset

 copies.
 So the number of processors needed will be reduced to 
\begin_inset Formula $1/N_{R}$
\end_inset

, while the running time will be multipled by 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{R}$
\end_inset

.

\begin_layout Standard
We find the 
\shape italic
sander
\shape default
 module to be a flexible way of incorporating a variety of restraints into
 a optimization procedure that includes energy minimization and dynamical
 simulated annealing.
 The "standard" sorts of NMR restraints, derived from NOE and J-coupling
 data, can be entered in a way very similar to that of programs like DISGEO,
 DIANA or X-PLOR; an aliasing syntax allows for definitions of pseudo-atoms,
 connections with peak numbers in spectra, and the use of "ambiguous" constraint
s from incompletely-assigned spectra.
 More "advanced" features include the use of time-averaged constraints,
 use of multiple copies (LES) in conjunction with NMR refinement, and direct
 refinement against NOESY intensities, paramagnetic and diamagnetic chemical
 shifts, or residual dipolar couplings.
 In addition, a key strength of the program is its ability to carry out
 the refinements (usually near the final stages) using an explicit-solvent
 representation that incorporates force fields and simulation protocols
 that are known to give pretty accurate results in many cases for unconstrained
 simulations; this ability should improve predictions in regions of low
 constraint density and should help reduce the number of places where the
 force field and the NMR constraints are in "competition" with one another.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since there is no generally-accepted "recipe" for obtaining solution structures
 from NMR data, the comments below are intended to provide a guide to some
 commonly-used procedures.
 Generally speaking, the programs that need to be run to obtain NMR structures
 can be divided into three parts:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\shape italic
front-end
\shape default
 modules, which interact with NMR databases that provide information about
 assignments, chemical shifts, coupling constants, NOESY intensities, and
 so on.
 We have tried to make the general format of the input straightforward enough
 so that it could be interfaced to a variety of programs.
 We generally use the FELIX and NMRView codes, but the principles should
 be similar for other ways of keeping track of a database of NMR spectral
 information.
 As the flow-chart in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:nmr-to-rst"

\end_inset

 indicates, there are only a few files that need to be created for NMR restraint
s; these are indicated by the solid rectangles.
 The primary distance and torsion angle files have a fairly simple format
 that is largely compatible with the DIANA programs; if one wishes to use
 information from ambiguous or overlapped peaks, there is an additional
 "MAP" file that makes a translation from peak identifiers to ambiguous
 (or partial) assignments.
 Finally, there are some specialized (but still pretty straightforward)
 file formats for chemical shift or residual dipolar coupling restraints.

 New as of Amber 10 (
\shape italic
sander
\shape default
 only), users may now use a "natural language" system to define restraints
 by using the RESTRAINT character variable.
 Valid restraints defined in this manner will begin with a "distance( )"
 "angle( )" "torsion( )" or "coordinate( )" keyword.
 Within the parentheses, the atoms that make up the restraint are specified.
 Atoms may be defined either with an explicit atom number or by using ambmask
 format, namely :(residue#)@(atom name).
 Atoms may be separated by commas, spaces, or parentheses.
 Additionally, negative integers may be used if atom groupings are defined
 in other variables in the namelist as described below.
 In addition to the principle distance, angle, torsion, and coordinate keywords,
 Some keywords may be used within the principle keywords to define more
 complicated restraints.
 The keyword "plane( )" may be used once or twice within the parentheses
 of the "angle( ) keyword to define a planar restraint.
 Defining one plane grouping plus one other atom in this manner will create
 a plane-point angle restraint as described above.
 Defining two plane groupings will create a plane-plane angle restraint.
 The keyword "plane( )" may only be used inside of "angle( )," and is necessary
 to define either a plane-point or plane-plane restraint.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 Within the "coordinate( )" keyword, the user must use 2 to 4 "distance(
 )" keywords to define a generalized distance coordinate restraint.
 The "distance( )" keyword functions just like it does when used to define
 a traditional distance restraint.
 The user may specify any two atom numbers, masks, or negative numbers correspon
ding to atom groups defined outside of RESTRAINT.
 Additionally, following each "distance( )" keyword inside "coordinate(
 )" the user must specify a real-number weight to be applied to each distance
 making up the generalized coordinate.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 The "com( )" keyword may be used within any other keyword to define a center
 of mass grouping of atoms.
 Within the parenthesis, the user will enter a list of atom numbers or masks.
 Negative numbers, which correspond to externally-defined groups, may not
 be used.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 Any type of parenthetical character, i.e., ( ), [ ], or { }, may be used
 wherever parentheses have been used above.

rjcoef(3) By default, 4-atom sequences specify torsional restraints.
 It is also possible to impose restraints on the vicinal 3 J-coupling value
 related to the underlying torsion.
 J is related to the torsion 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$

 by the approximate Karplus relationship: 
\begin_inset Formula $J=A\cos^{2}(\tau)+B\cos(\tau)+C$
\end_inset

.
 If you specify a nonzero value for either RJCOEF(1) or RJCOEF(2), then
 a J-coupling restraint, rather than a torsional restraint, will be imposed.
 At every MD step, J will be calculated from the Karplus relationship with
 A = RJCOEF(1), B = RJCOEF(2) and C = RJCOEF(3).
 In this case, the target values (R1-

 With respect to other options and reporting, J-coupling restraints are
 treated identically to torsional restraints.
 This means that if time-averaging is requested for torsional restraints,
 it will apply to J-coupling restraints as well.
 The J-coupling restraint contribution to the energy is included in the
 "torsional" total.
 And changes in the relative weights of the torsional force constants also
 change the relative weights of the J-coupling restraint terms.
 Setting RJCOEF has no effect for distance and angle restraints.

 A value of 0.02 - 0.05 ns is probably better than 0.0001, but this is still

Pseudocontact shift restraints
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The PCSHIFT module allows the inclusion of pseudocontact shifts as constraints
 in energy minimization and molecular dynamics calculations on paramagnetic
 molecules.
 The pseudocontact shift depends on the magnetic susceptibility anisotropy
 of the metal ion and on the location of the resonating nucleus with respect
 to the axes of the magnetic susceptibility tensor.
 For the nucleus i, it is given by: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\delta_{pc}^{i}=\sum_{j}\frac{1}{12\pi r_{ij}^{3}}\left[\Delta\chi_{ax}^{j}(3n_{ij}^{2}-1)+(3/2)\Delta\chi_{rh}^{j}(l_{ij}^{2}-m_{ij}^{2})\right]
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $l_{ij}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{ij}$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{ij}$
\end_inset

 are the direction cosines of the position vector of atom i with respect
 to the j-th magnetic susceptibility tensor coordinate system, 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{ij}$

\begin_layout Standard
The PCSHIFT module to be used needs a namelist file which includes information
 on the magnetic susceptibility tensor and on the paramagnetic center, and
 a line of information for each nucleus.
 This module allows to include more than one paramagnetic center in the
 calculations.
 To include pseudocontact shifts as constraints in energy minimization and
 molecular dynamics calculations the NMROPT flag should be set to 2, and
 a

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To perform molecular dynamics calculations it is necessary to eliminate
 the rotational and translational degree of freedom about the center of
 mass (this because during molecular dynamics calculations the relative
 orientation between the external reference coordinate system and the magnetic
 anisotropy tensor coordinate system has to be fixed).This option can be
 obtained with the NSCM flag of

Direct dipolar coupling restraints
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Energy restraints based on direct dipolar coupling constants are entered
 in this section.
 All variables are in the namelist &align; reading of this section is triggered
 by the presence of a DIPOLE line in the I/O redirection section.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When dipolar coupling restraints are turned on, the five unique elements
 of the alignment tensor are treated as additional variables, and are optimized
 along with the structural parameters.
 Their effective masses are determined by the 
\shape italic
scalm
\shape default
 parameter entered in the &cntrl namelist.
 Unlike some other programs, the variables used are the Cartesian components
 of the alignment tensor in the axis system defined by the molecule itself:
 
\begin_inset Formula $e.g.$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{mn}\equiv\left\langle (3\cos\theta_{m}\cos\theta_{n}-\delta_{mn})/2\right\rangle $
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $m,n=x,y,z$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{x}$
\end_inset

 is the angle between the 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 axis and the spectrometer field.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Sanders94"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 The factor of 10
\begin_inset Formula $^{5}$
\end_inset

 is just to make the values commensurate with atomic coordinates, since
 both the coordinates and the alignment tensor values will be updated during
 the refinement.
 The calculated dipolar splitting is then 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
D_{calc}=-\left(\frac{10^{-5}\gamma_{i}\gamma_{j}h}{2\pi^{2}r_{ij}^{3}}\right)\sum_{m,n=xyz}\cos\phi_{m}\cdot S_{mn}\cdot\cos\phi_{n}
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{x}$
\end_inset

 is the angle between the internuclear vector and the 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 axis.
 Geometrically, the splitting is proportional to the transformation of the
 alignment tensor onto the internuclear axis.
 This is just Eqs.
 (5) and (13) of the above reference, with any internal motion corrections
 (which might be a part of 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{system}$
\end_inset

) set to unity.
 If there is an internal motion correction which is the same for all observation
s, this can be assimilated into the alignment tensor.
 The current code does not allow for variable corrections for internal motion.
 See Ref.

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\shape italic
7/8 column distance bound
\shape default
 file is essentially that used by the DIANA or DISGEO programs.
 It consists of one-line per restraint, which would typically look like
 the following:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
23 ALA HA 52 VAL H 3.8 # comments go here
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first three columns identify the first proton, the next three the second
 proton, and the seventh column gives the upper bound.
 Only the first three letters of the residue name are used, so that DIANA
 files that contain residues like "ASP-" will be correctly interpreted.
 An alternate, 8-column, format has both upper and lower bounds as the seventh
 and eighth columns, respectively.
 A typical line might in an "8-col" file might look like this:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
23 ALA HA 52 VAL H 3.2 3.8 # comments go here
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here the lower bound is 3.2

\end_inset

 and the upper bound is 3.8 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
AA
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Comments typically identify the spectrum and peak-number or other identificatio
n that allow cross-referencing back to the appropriate spectrum.
 If the comment contains the pattern "
\begin_inset Formula $<$
\end_inset

integer
\begin_inset Formula $>$
\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula $<$
\end_inset

integer
\begin_inset Formula $>$
\end_inset

", then the first integer is treated as a peak-identifier, and the second
 as a spectrum-identifier.
 These identifiers go into the 
\shape italic
ixpk
\shape default
 and 
\shape italic
nxpk
\shape default
 variables, and will later be printed out in 
\shape italic
sander
\shape default
, to facilitate going back to the original spectra to track down violations,
 etc.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The format for the 
\shape italic
-vol
\shape default
 option is the same as for the 
\shape italic
-upb
\shape default
 option except that the seventh column holds a peak intensity (volume) value,
 rather than a distance upper bound.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The input PDB file must exactly match the Amber 
\shape italic

\shape default

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If all peaks involved just single protons, and were fully assigned, this
 is all that one would need.
 In general, though, some peaks (especially methyl groups or fast-rotating
 aromatic rings) represent contributions from more than one proton, and
 many other peaks may not be fully assigned.
 
\shape italic
Sander
\shape default
 handles both of these situations in the same way, through the notion of
 an "ambiguous" peak, that may correspond to several assignments.
 These peaks are given two types of special names in the 7/8-column format
 file:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Commonly-occurring ambiguities, like the lack of stereospecific assignments
 to two methylene protons, are given names defined in the default MAP file.
 These names, also more-or-less consistent with DIANA, are like the names
 of "pseudo-atoms" that have long been used to identify such partially assigned
 peaks, e.g.
 "QB" refers to the (HB2,HB3) combination in most residues, and "MG1" in
 valine refers collectively to the three methyl protons at position CG1,
 etc.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
There are generally also molecule-specific ambiguities, arising from potential
 overlap in a NOESY spectrum.
 Here, the user assigns a unique name to each such ambiguity or overlap,
 and prepares a list of the potential assignments.
 The names are arbitrary, but might be constructed, for example, from the
 chemical shifts that identify the peak, e.g.
 "p_2.52" might identify the set of protons that could contribute to a peak
 at 2.52 ppm.
 The chemical shift list can be used to prepare a list of potential assignments,
 and these lists can often be pruned by comparison to approximate or initial
 structures.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The default and molecule-specific MAP files are combined into a single file,
 which is used, along with the 7-column restraint file, the the program
 
\shape italic
makeDIST_RST
\shape default
 to construct the actual 
\shape italic
sander
\shape default
 input files.
 You should consult the help file for makeDIST_RST for more information.
 For example, here are some lines added to the MAP file for a recent TSRI
 refinement:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
AMBIG n2:87 = HN 71 HH2 66 HZ3 66 HD1 66
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here the spectrum name and peak number were used to construct a label for
 each ambiguous peak.
 Then, an entry in the restraint file might look like this:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\begin_layout Standard

\end_layout

\end_inset

 upper bound between the amide proton of Gly 123 and a second proton, which
 might be either the HE or HZ protons of residue 86.
 (The "zero" residue number just serves as a placeholder, so that there
 will be the same number of columns as for non-ambiguous restraints.) If
 it is possible that the ambiguous list might not be exhaustive (e.g.
 if some protons have not been assigned), it is safest to set 
\shape italic
ialtd
\shape default
=1, which will allow "mistakes" to be present in the constraint list.
 On the other hand, if you want to be sure that every violation is "active",
 set 
\shape italic
ialtd
\shape default
=0.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the 
\shape italic
-les
\shape default
 flag is set, the program will prepare distance restraints for multiple
 copies (LES) simulations.
 In this case, the input PDB file is one 
\shape italic
without
\shape default
 LES copies, i.e.
 with just a single copy of the molecule.
 The "lesfile" specified by this flag is created by the 
\shape italic
addles
\shape default
 program, and contains a mapping from original atom numbers into the copy
 numbers used in the multiple-copies simulation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\shape italic
-rst
\shape default
 and 
\shape italic
-svf
\shape default
 flags specify outputs for 
\shape italic
sander
\shape default
, for distance restraints and NOESY restraints, respectively.
 In each case, you may need to hand-edit the outputs to add additional parameter
s.
 You should make it a habit to compare the outputs with the descriptions
 given earlier in this chapter to make sure that the restraints are what
 you want them to be.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is common to run makeDIST_RST several times, with different inputs that
 correspond to different spectra, different mixing times, etc.
 It is then expected that you will manually edit the various output files
 to combine them into the single file required by

 When a torsion angle contains atom(s) from a preceding or succeeding residue
 in the structure, a "-" or "+" is appended to those atom names in the library,
 thereby specifying that this is the case.
 In the example above, the atoms that define PSI for LEU residues are the
 N, CA, and C atoms of that same LEU and the N atom of the residue after
 that LEU in the primary structure.
 Note that the order of atoms in the definition is important and should
 reflect that the torsion angle rotates about the two central atoms as well
 as the fact that the four atoms are bonded in the order that is specified
 in the definition.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the first letter of the second field is "J", this torsion is assumed
 to be a J-coupling constraint.
 In that case, three additional floats are read at the end of the line,
 giving the A,B and C coefficients for the Karplus relation for this torsion.
 For example:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
ALA JHNA H N CA HA 9.5 -1.4 0.3
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
will set up a J-coupling restraint for the HN-HA 3-bond coupling, assuming
 a Karplus relation with A,B, C as 9.5, -1.4 and 0.3.
 (These particular values are from Br√ºschweiler and Case, JACS 116: 11199
 (1994).)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This program also supports pseudorotation phase angle constraints for prolines
 and nucleic acid sugars; each of these will generate restraints for the
 5 component angles which correspond to the 
\shape italic
lb
\shape default
 and 
\shape italic
ub
\shape default
 values of the input pseudorotation constraint.
 In the torsion library, a pseudorotation definition looks like:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
PSEUDO CYT PPA NU0 NU1 NU2 NU3 NU4
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
CYT NU0 C4' O4' C1' C2'
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
CYT NU3 C2' C3' C4' O4'
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
CYT NU4 C3' C4' O4' C1'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first line describes that a PSEUDOrotation angle is to be defined for
 CYT that is called PPA and is made up of the five angles NU0-NU4.
 Then the definition for NU0-NU4 should also appear in the file in the same
 format as the example given above for LEU PSI.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
PPA stands for Pseudorotation Phase Angle and is the angle that should appear
 in the input constraint file when using pseudorotation constraints.
 The program then uses the definition of that PPA angle in the library file
 to look for the 5 other angles (NU0-NU4 in this case) which it then generates
 restraints for.
 PPA for proline residues is included in the standard library as well as
 for the DNA nucleotides.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the 
\shape italic
-les
\shape default
 flag is set, the program will prepare torsion angle restraints for multiple
 copies (LES) simulations.
 In this case, the input PDB file is one 
\shape italic
without
\shape default
 LES copies, i.e.
 with just a single copy of the molecule.
 The "lesfile" specified by this flag is created by the 
\shape italic
addles
\shape default
 program, and contains a mapping from original atom numbers into the copy
 numbers used in the multiple-copies simulation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Torsion angle constraints defined here cannot span two different copy sets,
 i.e., there cannot be some atoms of a particular torsion that are in one
 multiple copy set, and other atoms from the same torsion that are in other
 copy sets.
 It 
\shape italic
is
\shape default
 OK to have some atoms with single copies, and others with multiple copies
 in the same torsion.
 The program will create as many duplicate torsions as there are copies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A good alternative to interpreting J-coupling constants in terms of torsion
 angle restraints is to refine directly against the coupling constants themselve
s, using an appropriate Karplus relation.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Use of residual dipolar coupling restraints is new both for Amber and for
 the general NMR community.
 Refinement against these data should be carried out with care, and the
 optimal values for the force constant, penalty function, and initial guesses
 for the alignment tensor components are still under investigation.
 Here are some suggestions from the experiences so far:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Beware of overfitting the dipolar coupling data in the expense of Amber
 force field energy.
 These dipolar coupling data are very sensitive to tiny changes in the structure.
 It is often possible to drastically improve the fitting by making small
 distortions in the backbone angles.
 We recommend inclusion of explicit angle restraints to enforce ideal backbone
 geometry, especially for those residues that have corresponding residual
 dipolar coupling data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The initial values for the Cartesian components of the alignment tensor
 can influence the final structure and alignment if the structure is not
 fixed (ibelly = 0).
 For a fixed structure (ibelly = 1), these values do not matter.
 Therefore, the current "best" strategy is to fit the experimental data
 to the fixed starting structure, and use the alignment tensor[s] obtained
 from this fitting as the initial guesses for further refinement.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Amber is capable of simultaneously fitting more than one set of alignment
 data.
 This allows the use of individually obtained datasets with different alignment
 tensors.
 However, if the different sets of data have equal directions of alignment
 but different magnitudes, using an overall scaling factor for these data
 with a single alignment tensor could greatly reduce the number of fitting
 parameters.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Because the dipolar coupling splittings depend on the square root of the
 order parameters (0 
\begin_inset Formula $\le$
\end_inset

 S2 
\begin_inset Formula $\le$
\end_inset

1), these order parameters describing internal motion of individual residues
 are often neglected (N.
 Tjandra and A.
 Bax, 
\shape italic
Science
\shape default
 
\series bold
278
\series default
, 1111-1113, 1997).
 However, the square root of a small number can still be noticeably smaller
 than 1, so this may introduce undesirable errors in the calculations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Using NMR exchange format (NEF) files
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The NMR community, in collaboration with the worldwide PDB, is developing
 a common format for encoding of NMR restraints, including all of the kinds
 discussed above.
 This format is not yet finalized, but we are including here a conversion
 script, 
\emph on
nef_to_RST

, that would convert these files to 
\emph on

 Because this format is so new, and is still subject to revisions, care
 should be taken in using this script: make sure that the output files do
 what they should be doing.

Getting summaries of NMR violations

\begin_layout Standard
If you specify LISTOUT=POUT when running 
\shape italic

\shape default
, the output file will contain a lot of detailed information about the remaining
 restraint violations at the end of the run.
 When running a family of structures, it can be useful to process these
 output files with 
\shape italic
sviol
\shape default
, which takes a list of 
\shape italic

 output files on the command line, and sends a summary of energies and violation
s to STDOUT.
 If you have more than 20 or so structures to analyze, the output from 
\shape italic

\shape default
 becomes unwieldy.
 In this case you may also wish to use 
\shape italic

\shape default
, which prints out somewhat less detailed information, but which can be
 used on larger families of structures.
 The

Time-averaged restraints
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The model of the previous sections involves the "single-average-structure"
 idea, and tries to fit all constraints to a single model, with minimal
 deviations.
 A generalization of this model treats distance constraints arising from
 from NOE crosspeaks (for example) as being the average distance determined
 from a trajectory, rather than as the single distance derived from an average
 structure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Time-averaged bonds and angles are calculated as

\begin_inset Formula

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling

\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
<\varphi>=\tan^{-1}\left(<\sin(\phi)>/<\cos(\phi)>\right)
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 is the torsion, and 
\begin_inset Formula $<\sin(\phi)>$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $<\cos(\phi)>$
\end_inset

 are calculated using the equation above with 
\begin_inset Formula $\sin(\phi(t'))$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\cos(\phi(t'))$
\end_inset

 substituted for 
\begin_inset Formula $r(t')$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Forces for time-averaged restraints can be calculated either of two ways.
 This option is chosen with the DISAVI / ANGAVI / TORAVI commands.
 In the first (the default), 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\partial E/\partial x=(\partial E/\partial\bar{r})(\partial\bar{r}/\partial r(t))(\partial r(t)/\partial x)\label{eq:tavforce1}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

(and analogously for y and z).
 The forces then correspond to the standard flat-bottomed well functional
 form, with the instantaneous value of the internal replaced by the time-average
d value.
 For example, when 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{3}<\bar{r}<r_{4}$
\end_inset

,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
E=k_{3}(\bar{r}-r_{3})^{2}
\]

\end_inset

and similarly for other ranges of 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{r}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the second option for calculating forces is chosen (IINC = 1 on a DISAVI,
 ANGAVI or TORAVI card), forces are calculated as
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\partial E/\partial x=(\partial E/\partial\bar{r})(\partial r(t)/\partial x)\label{eq:tavforce2}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

For example, when 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{3}<\bar{r}<r_{4}$
\end_inset

, 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\partial E/\partial x=2k_{3}(\bar{r}-r_{3})(\partial r(t)/\partial x)
\]

\end_inset

Integration of this equation does not give Eq.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:tavforce1"

\end_inset

, but rather a non-intuitive expression for the energy (although one that
 still forces the bond to the target range).
 The reason that it may sometimes be preferable to use this second option
 is that the term 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial\bar{r}/\partial r(t)$
\end_inset

, which occurs in the exact expression [Eq.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:tavforce1"

\end_inset

], varies as 
\begin_inset Formula $(\bar{r}/r(t))^{1+i}$
\end_inset

.
 When 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

=3, this means the forces can be varying with the fourth power the distance,
 which can possibly lead to very large transient forces and instabilities
 in the molecular dynamics trajectory.
 [Note that this will not be the case when linear scaling is performed,
 i.e.
 when 
\begin_inset Formula $i=-$
\end_inset

1, as is generally the case for valence and torsion angles.
 Thus, for linear scaling, the default (exact) force calculation should
 be used].
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It should be noted that forces calculated using Eq.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:tavforce2"

\end_inset

 are not conservative forces, and would cause the system to gradually heat
 up, if no velocity rescaling were performed.
 The temperature coupling algorithm should act to maintain the average temperatu
re near the target value.
 At any rate, this heating tendency should not be a problem in simulations,
 such as fitting NMR data, where MD is being used to sample conformational
 space rather than to extract thermodynamic data.

Multiple copies refinement using LES
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
NMR restraints can be made compatible with the multiple copies (LES) facility;
 see the following chapter for more information about LES.
 To use NMR constraints with LES, you need to do two things:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(1) Add a line like "file wnmr name=(lesnmr) wovr" to your input to 
\shape italic
addles.

\shape default
 The filename (lesnmr in this example) may be whatever you wish.
 This will cause 
\shape italic
addles
\shape default
 to output an additional file that is needed at the next step.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(2) Add "-les lesnmr" to the command line arguments to 
\shape italic
makeDIST_RST
\shape default
.
 This will read in the file created by 
\shape italic
addles
\shape default
 containing information about the copies.
 All NMR restraints will then be interpreted as "ambiguous" restraints,
 so that if any of the copies satisfies the restraint, the penalty goes
 to zero.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that although this scheme has worked well on small peptide test cases,
 we have yet not used it extensively for larger problems.
 This should be treated as an experimental option, and users should use
 caution in applying or interpreting the results.

 somewhat to fit your problem, but these values work well for many "ordinary"

 was developed to incorporate electron microscopy (EM) image information
 into macromolecular structure determination.
 Different from NMR and X-ray data, EM images have low resolutions (5~50√Ö).
 However, EM images of large molecular assemblies up to millions of atoms
 and in various biologically relevant environments are available.
 These low resolution images provide precious structural information that
 can help to determine structures of many molecular assemblies and machineries

 In addition to experimental map information, homologous structural information

 induce simulation systems to form structures of interest.

Simulations of biomolecular crystals are in principle no different than
 any of the simulations that AMBER does in periodic boundary conditions.
 However, the setup of these systems is not trivial and probably cannot
 be accomplished with the LEaP software.
 Of principal importance are the construction of the solvent conditions
 (packing precise amounts of multiple solvent species into the simulation
 cell), and tailoring the unit cell dimensions to accommodate the inherently
 periodic nature of the system.
 The LEaP software, designed to construct simulations of molecules in solution,
 will overlay a pre-equilibrated solvent mask over the (biomolecular) solute,
 tile that mask throughout the simulation cell, and then prune solvent residues
 which clash with the solute.
 The result of this procedure is a system which will likely contract under
 constant pressure dynamics as the pruning process has left vacuum bubbles
 at the solute:solvent interface.
 Simulations of biomolecular crystals require that the simulation cell begin
 at a size corresponding to the crystallographic unit cell, and deviate
 very little from that size over the course of equilibration and onset of
 constant pressure dynamics.
 This demands a different strategy for placing solvent in the simulation
 cell.
 Four programs in the 
\emph on
AmberTools
\emph default
 release are designed to accomplish this.
 An example of their use in given in a web-based tutorial at 
\emph on

 A recent (2018) review of crystal simulations is also worth consulting.

UnitCell
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A macromolecular crystal contains many repeating unit cells which stack
 like blocks in three dimensional space just as simulation cells do in periodic
 boundary conditions.
 Each unit cell, in turn, may contain multiple symmetry-related clusters
 of atoms.
 A PDB file contains one set of coordinates for the irreducible unit of
 the crystal, the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

asymmetric unit,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and also information about the crystal space group and unit cell dimensions.
 The 
\emph on
UnitCell
\emph default
 program reads PDB files, seeking the SMTRY records within the REMARKs to
 enumerate the rotation and translation operations which may be applied
 to the coordinates given in the PDB file to reconstruct one complete unit
 cell.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Usage of the 
\shape italic
UnitCell

 program is as follows.
 The simple command rests on a critical assumption, that the PDB file contains
 an accurate CRYST1 record and that the REMARK 290 SMTRY records provide
 its space group symmetry operations.

PropPDB
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Simulations in periodic boundary conditions require a minimum unit cell
 size: the simulation cell must be able to enclose a sphere of at least
 the nonbonded direct space cutoff radius plus a small buffer region for
 nonbonded pairlist updates.
 Many biomolecular crystal unit cells come in 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

shoebox
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 dimensions that may have one very short side; many unit cells are also
 not rectangular but triclinic, meaning that the size of the largest sphere
 they can enclose is further reduced.
 The workhorse simulation engine, pmemd.cuda, even requires that the simulation
 cell be at least three times as thick as the cutoff plus some buffer margin
 in order to run safely: for typical sum conditions this thickness is about
 30√Ö.
 For these reasons, and perhaps to ensure that the rigid symmetry imposed
 by periodic boundary conditions does not create artifacts (crystallographic
 unit cells are equivalent when averaged over all time and space, but are
 not necessarily identical at any given moment), it may be necessary to
 include multiple unit cells within the simulation cell.
 This is the purpose of the 
\emph on
PropPDB
\emph default
 program: to propagate a unit cell in one or more directions so that the
 complete simulation cell meets minimum size requirements.

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\emph on
AddToBox
\emph default
 program handles placement of solvent within a crystal unit cell or supercell
 (as may be created by PropPDB).
 As described in the introduction, the basic strategy is to place solvent
 such that added solvent molecules do not clash with biomolecule solutes,
 but 
\shape italic
may
\shape default
 clash with one another initially.
 This compromise is necessary because enough solvent must be added to the
 system to ensure that the correct unit cell dimensions are maintained in
 the long run, but it is not acceptable to place solvent within the interior
 of a biomolecule where it might not belong and never escape.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\emph on
AddToBox
\emph default
 program takes a PDB file providing the coordinates of a complete biomolecular
 unit cell or supercell (argument -c), the dimensions by which that supercell
 repeats in space (the unit cell dimensions are taken from the CRYST1 record
 of this file), a PDB file describing the solvent residue to add (argument
 -a), and the number of copies of that solvent molecule to add (argument
 -na).
 
\emph on
AddToBox
\emph default
 inherently assumes that the biomolecular unit cell it is initially presented
 may contain some amount of solvent already, and according to the AMBER
 convention of listing macromolecular solute atoms first and solvent last
 assumes that the first -P atoms in the file are the protein (or biomolecule).
 
\emph on
AddToBox
\emph default
 will then color a very fine grid 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

black
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 if the grid point is within a certain distance of a biomolecular atom (argument
 -RP, default 5.0√Ö) or other solvent atom (argument -RW, default 1.0√Ö); the
 grid is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

white
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 otherwise (the grid is stored in binary for memory efficiency).
 
\emph on
AddToBox
\emph default
 will the make a copy of the solvent residue and randomly rotate and translate
 it somewhere within the unit cell.
 If all atoms of the solvent residue land on 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

white
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 grid voxels, the solvent molecule will become part of the system and the
 grid around the newly added solvent will be blacked out accordingly.
 If the solvent molecule cannot be placed, this process will be repeated
 until a million consecutive failures are encountered, at which point the
 program will terminate.
 If 
\emph on
AddToBox
\emph default
 has not placed the requested number of solvent molecules by the time it
 terminates, the -V option can be used to order the program to recursively
 call itself with progressively smaller solvent buffer distances until all
 the requested solvent can be placed.
 The output of the 
\emph on
AddToBox
\emph default
 program is another PDB named by the -o option.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Successful operation of 
\emph on
AddToBox
\emph default
 may take practice.
 If multiple solvent species are required, as is the case with heterogeneous
 crystallization solutions, 
\emph on
AddToBox
\emph default
 may be called repeatedly with each input molecular cell being the previous
 call's output.
 When considering crystal solvation, the order of addition is important!
 It is recommended that rare species, such as trace buffer reagents, be
 added first, with large -RW argument to ensure that they are dispersed
 throughout the available crystal void zones.
 Large solvent species such as MPD (an isohexane diol commonly used in crystalli
zation conditions) should be added second, and with a sufficiently large
 -RW argument that methyl groups and ring systems cannot become interlocked
 (which will likely lead to SHAKE / vlimit errors).
 Small and abundant species such as water should be added last, as they
 can go anywhere that space remains.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The use of the -V flag ensures that the desired amounts of each species
 are included.
 The protein clipping radius of 3√Ö is lower than the default, but safe (remember
, this radius stipulates that no solvent atom, regardless of the size of
 the solvent molecule, come within 3√Ö of the protein).
 Note how the original protein PDB file serves as the base for system, but
 thereafter we work with the System.pdb to accumulate more solvent particles.
 Here, the ammonium sulfate serves both to neutralize the system and replicate
 a salty bath, perhaps from a crystallization mother liquor, hence the break
 from the usual 2:1 stoichiometry of ammonium sulfate ions.

It is likely that the unobservable

 regions between biomolecules in most crystals 
\shape italic
do not
\shape default
 contain solvent species in proportion to their abundance in the crystallization
 solution‚Äìthe vast majority of these regions are within a few ‚Ñ´ngstroms
 of some biomolecular surface, and different biomolecular functional groups
 will preferentially interact with some types of solvent over others.
 Also, in many crystals some solvent molecules 
\shape italic
are
\shape default
 observed; in many of these, the amount of solvent observed is such that
 it would be impossible to pack other species into the unit cell in proportion
 to their abundances in the crystallization fluid.
 In these cases, we recommend estimating the amount of volume that must
 be filled with solvent 
\shape italic
apart from solvent which has already been observed in the crystal
\shape default
, and filling this void with solvent in proportion to the composition of
 the crystallization fluid.
 For example, if a crystal were grown in a 1:1 mole-to-mole water/ethanol
 mixture, and the crystal coordinates as deposited in the PDB contained
 500 water molecules and 3 ethanol molecules, we would use 
\emph on
AddToBox
\emph default
 to add water and ethanol in a 1:1 ratio until the system contained enough
 solvent to maintain the correct volume during equilibrium dynamics at constant
 pressure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, it is difficult to estimate exactly how much solvent will be needed
 to maintain the correct equilibrium volume; the advisable approach is simply
 to make an initial guess and script the setup so that, over multiple runs
 and reconstructions, the correct system composition can be found.
 We recommend matching the equilibrium unit cell volume to within 0.3% to
 keep this simulation parameter within the error of most crystallographic
 measurements.
 While errors of 0.5-1% will show up quickly after constant pressure dynamics
 begin, a 10 to 20ns simulation may be needed to ensure that the correct
 equilibrium volume has been achieved.

 By using the

 If visualized, the output of UnitCell / PropPDB will likely look jagged,

 jutting out one face of the box fit neatly into open spaces on an opposite

 It is expected that the crystal is solvated using an explicit (or implicit)
 solvent.
 While a number of crystallographic concepts are implemented in the new
 Amber module, many others have not yet been implemented.
 For example, an MD model of a crystal unit cell can naturally accommodate
 different side-chain conformations; however, the concept of alternate side-chai

; a mask is available to define the subset of atoms included in these calculatio
ns (
\emph on

 For example, this mask could select the macromolecules, but not the solvent
 or the neutralizing ions present in the simulation.
 The B-factors used in the direct summation formula are supplied through
 a designated PDB file.
 The set of Miller indices for SF calculations is supplied as a part of
 the 
\emph on

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In principle, explicit solvent and ions can also be accounted for via the
 direct summation formula.
 However, any single individual frame does not offer an adequate statistical
 sampling with regard to the positioning of water molecules (if desired,
 such statistical sampling can be obtained by modeling of a very large supercell
 or otherwise by means of time averaging).
 As a commonly accepted alternative, Amber 22 offers two mask-based models
 of bulk solvent.
 The first one (

 to the one in cctbx library

 The more advanced version (

It is worth noting that crystal MD simulations in Amber (as described in

 Ultimately, the entire process of crystallographic structure determination
 can be incorporated into Amber.
 This approach may be particularly valuable for lower-quality diffraction
 data sets and incomplete structural models (e.g.
 in the case of weak or missing electron density for mobile side chains,
 loops or terminal regions in protein molecules).
 In this situation, the state-of-the-art force field provides a natural
 solution to model the poorly resolved or unresolved elements of the structure.
 This is accomplished in a highly realistic manner, by using the explicit
 representation of the crystal unit cell (supercell), taking into consideration
 the effect of solvent, crystal contacts, etc.

Auxiliary scripts for X-ray refinement
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This section gives a bird's-eye view of capabilities of the some useful
 auxiliary scripts.
 The hope is to get more detailed examples and documentation as time permits.
 The organization is based on the compuational tools required, which almost
 certainly not the best approach.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
ccp4_scripts
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These scripts are based on the 
\emph on
CCP4
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
refmac5
\emph default
 programs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
conf_solvent.sh Takes an electron density for the solvent (say from MD simulation
s or from integral equation models), plus an atomic model for the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

solute
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (generally a macromolecule like a protein), and refines the model with
 
\emph on
refmac5
\emph default
.
 As a comparison, ignores the input solvent density and uses the standard
 
\emph on
refmac5 
\emph default
bulk solvent contribution, as would be done in a conventional simulation.
 This offers one way to see if the input density is any 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

better
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 than the standard solvent contribution.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
md2diffuse.sh Takes snapshots from an MD simulation, and works through the
 steps to compute both the Bragg intensities and diffuse intensities.
 The 
\emph on
sfall
\emph default
 program is the key engine to compute scattering amplitudes.
 Special attention is paid to reducing disk space requirements, so that
 scattering amplitudes from many snapshots can be stored and analyzed.
 The code optionally will constuct map coefficients and an electron density
 map arising from the simulation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
md2map.sh
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
mdv2map.sh The two scripts compute the average electron density, as a CCP4
 map and as map coefficients, from an input MD simulation.
 Unlike the 
\series bold
md2diffuse.sh
\series default
 script, which computes the average scattering amplitudes, then uses an
 FFT to obtain the final map, these two scripts directly add the maps together,
 then uses a Fourier transform to obtain the map coefficients.
 Since no diffuse scattering information is needed, there is much less need
 to optimize disk space; still the overall amount of computation is about
 the same, 
\emph on
i.e.

\emph default
 that required to run 
\emph on
sfall
\emph default
 on each frame of the input trajectory.
 The 
\series bold
mdv2map.sh
\series default
 script assumes that the unit cell dimensions don't change throughout the
 trajectory, whereas 
\series bold
md2map.sh
\series default
 does not make this assumption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
phenix_scripts
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
XrayPrep This script currently has two parts, which can be run together,
 or separately.
 The first part uses the 
\emph on
phenix.AmberPrep
\emph default
 script to prepare an input pdb-format file for use in refinement.
 It usually works well, but is limited in its ability to handle unusual
 situations, such as post-translational modifications, etc.
 See the 
\emph on
run_alt_tleap
\emph default
 script below for a more flexible alternative.
 The second part of the script takes an 
\emph on
xxx-sf-cif
\emph default
 file from the PDB, and converts the information into files needed for amber-bas
ed refinement.
 This uses 
\emph on
phenix.refine
\emph default
 to do conversions, reject outliers, possible convert intensities to structure
 factors, expand to P1 symmetry, and so on.
 (Going forward, I will probably remove the first part of this script.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
CryoPrep These two scripts take an atomic model (in the form of a PDB-format
 file), and either an electron density (as a CCP4 map) or structure factors
 (as an sf-cif file), and prepare all the files needed to carry out refinements
 that employ a molecular force field (rather than Engh-Huber like distance
 and angle restraints) to constrain the molecular geometry.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
run_phenix.solvent This is a sample script to allow comparisons of the bulk-solve
nt model in 
\emph on
phenix
\emph default
 and a user-supplied solvent density.
 Unlike the 
\series bold
conf_solvent.sh
\series default
 script based on 
\emph on
refmac5
\emph default
, this only works for a single-point, and doesn't carry out refinements
 that include the user-supplied solvent density.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
run_phenix_refine This is just an alternative way to run 
\emph on
phenix.refine
\emph default
 from the command line, with flexible ways to choose the input paramters.
 It's probably not for everyone.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
run_fmodel This just runs 
\emph on

\emph default
 and re-formats the output in a simple but occasionally useful way.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
rism_scripts
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
run_rism A simple script to run 3D-rism calcualtions (using the

 program) on a single snapshot.
 Typical values for grid spacing, closure and solvent model are hard-wired
 here, but you should edit this if you wish to make changes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
run_metatwist_rho Takes the output from 
\emph on
run_rism

 is not yet ready.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
find_alts output a listing of alternate conformations found in an input
 pdb-file
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
select_alts this is the main script, that takes an input pdb file with alternate
 conformations (for example, as found in the PDB).
 For each chain, it randomly selects an alternate conformer for each residue,
 based on its input occupation.
 The output file sets all occupations to 1.0.
 This is commonly used to create a starting model for ensemble refinement.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
modify_pdb is a utility perl script for making all manner of modifications
 to PDB files, at least that can be done on a line-by-line basis.
 The scripts reads an input PDB file, makes whatever changes are coded in
 an intermediate section, and writes out the result.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
modify_frac is a variant of modify_pdb that allows modification based on
 fractional coordinates, useful for repacking coordinates into a single
 unit cell, and so on.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
collapse_pdb takes an ensemble model and converts it into a more standard

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
LEaP is the generic name given to the programs teLeap and xaLeap, which
 are generally run 
\emph on
via
\emph default
 the 
\emph on
tleap
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
xleap
\emph default
 shell scripts.
 These two programs share a common command language but the 
\emph on
xleap
\emph default
 program has been enhanced through the addition of an X-windows graphical
 user interface.
 The name LEaP is an acronym constructed from the names of the older AMBER
 software modules it replaces: link, edit, and parm.
 Thus, LEaP can be used to prepare input for the AMBER molecular mechanics
 programs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Concepts
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to effectively use LEaP it is necessary to understand the philosophy
 behind the program, especially the concepts of LEaP commands, variables,
 and objects.
 In addition to exploring these concepts, this section also addresses the
 use of external files and libraries with the program.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Commands
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A researcher uses LEaP by entering commands that manipulate objects.
 An object is just a basic building block; some examples of objects are
 ATOMs, RESIDUEs, UNITs, and PARMSETs.
 The commands that are supported within LEaP are described throughout the
 manual and are defined in detail in the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Command Reference
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 section.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The heart of LEaP is a command-line interface that accepts text commands
 which direct the program to perform operations on objects.
 All LEaP commands have one of the following two forms:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
command argument1 argument2 argument3 ...
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
variable = command argument1 argument2 ...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
edit ALA trypsin = loadPdb trypsin.pdb
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each command is followed by zero or more arguments that are separated by
 whitespace.
  (Whitespace is blanks, tabs, and commas; and as of Amber version 21 carriage
 returns are also treated as whitespace.) Some commands return objects which
 are then associated with a variable using an assignment (=) statement.
 Each command acts upon its arguments, and some of the commands modify their
 arguments' contents.
 The commands themselves are case-insensitive.
 That is, in the above example, 
\family typewriter
edit
\family default
 could have been entered as 
\family typewriter
Edit
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
eDiT
\family default
, or any combination of upper and lower case characters.
 Similarly, 
\family typewriter
loadPdb
\family default
 could have been entered a number of different ways, including 
\family typewriter
loadpdb
\family default
.
 In this manual, we frequently use a mixed case for commands.
 We do this to enhance the differences between commands and as a mnemonic
 device.
 Thus, while we write 
\family typewriter
createAtom
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
createResidue
\family default
, and 
\family typewriter
createUnit
\family default
 in the manual, the user can use any case when entering these commands into
 the program.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The arguments in the command text may be objects such as NUMBERs, STRINGs,
 or LISTs, or they may be variables.
 These two subjects are discussed next.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Variables
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A variable is a handle for accessing an object.
 A variable name can be any alphanumeric string whose first character is
 an alphabetic character.
 Alphanumeric means that the characters of the name may be letters, numbers,
 or special symbols such as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

*
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The following special symbols should not be used in variable names: dollar
 sign, comma, period (full stop), pound sign (hash), equals sign, space,
 semicolon, double quote, or the curly braces { and }.
 LEaP commands should not be used as variable names.
 Unlike commands, variable names are case-sensitive: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

ARG
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

arg
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 are different variables.
 Variables are associated with objects using an assignment statement not
 unlike that found in conventional programming languages such as Fortran
 or C.
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
mole = 6.02E23
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
MOLE = 6.02E23
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
myName = "Joe Smith"
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
listOf7Numbers = { 1.2 2.3 3.4 4.5 6 7 8 }
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the above examples, both mole and MOLE are variable names, whose contents
 are the same (6.02
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

√ó
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

10
\begin_inset Formula $^{\text{}}$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $^{23}$
\end_inset

).
 Despite the fact that both mole and MOLE have the same contents, they are
 not the same variable.
 This is due to the fact that variable names are case-sensitive.
 LEaP maintains a list of variables that are currently defined.
 This list can be displayed using the 
\family typewriter
list
\family default
 command.
 The contents of a variable can be printed using the 
\family typewriter
desc
\family default
 command.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Objects
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The object is the fundamental entity in LEaP.
 Objects range from the simple, such as NUMBERs and STRINGs, to the complex,
 such as UNITs, RESIDUEs and ATOMs.
 Complex objects have properties that can be altered using the 
\family typewriter
set
\family default
 command, and some complex objects can contain other objects.
 For example, RESIDUEs are complex objects that can contain ATOMs and have
 the properties: residue name, connect atoms, and residue type.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
NUMBERs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
NUMBERs are simple objects holding double-precision floating point numbers.
 They serve the same function as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

double precision
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 variables in Fortran and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

double
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 variables in C.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
STRINGs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
STRINGs are simple objects that are identical to character arrays in C and
 similar to character strings in Fortran.
 STRINGs store sequences of characters which may be delimited by double
 quote characters.
 Example strings are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
"Hello there"
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
"String with a "" (quote) character"
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
"Strings contain letters and numbers:1231232"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
LISTs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
LISTs are made up of sequences of other objects delimited by LIST open and
 close characters.
 The LIST open character is an open curly bracket ({) and the LIST close
 character is a close curly bracket (}).
 LISTs can contain other LISTs and be nested arbitrarily deep.
 Example LISTs are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
{ 1 2 3 4 }
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
{ 1.2 "string" }
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
{ 1 2 3 { 1 2 } { 3 4 } }
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
LISTs are used by many commands to provide a more flexible way of passing
 data to the commands.
 The 
\family typewriter
zMatrix
\family default
 command has two arguments, one of which is a LIST of LISTs where each subLIST
 contains between three and eight objects.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
PARMSETs (Parameter Sets)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
PARMSETs are objects that contain bond, angle, torsion, and non-bonding
 parameters for AMBER force field calculations.
 They are normally loaded from force field data files, such as 
\shape italic
parm94.dat
\shape default
, and frcmod files.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
ATOMs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
ATOMs are complex objects that do not contain any other objects.
 The ATOM object corresponds to the chemical concept of an atom.
 Thus, it is a single entity that may be bonded to other ATOMs and used
 as a building block for creating molecules.
 ATOMs have many properties that can be changed using the 
\family typewriter
set
\family default
 command.
 These properties are defined below.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
name This is a case-sensitive STRING property and it is the ATOM's name.
 The names for all ATOMs in a RESIDUE should be unique.
 The name has no relevance to molecular mechanics force field parameters;
 it is chosen arbitrarily as a means to identify ATOMs.
 Ideally, the name should correspond to the PDB standard, being 3 characters
 long except for hydrogens, which can have an extra digit as a 4
\begin_inset Formula $^{\text{th}}$
\end_inset

 character.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
type This is a STRING property.
 It defines the AMBER force field atom type.
 It is important that the character case match the canonical type definition
 used in the appropriate force field data (
\shape italic
*.dat
\shape default
) or frcmod file.
 For smooth operation, all atom types must have element and hybridization
 defined by the 
\family typewriter
addAtomTypes
\family default
 command.
 The standard AMBER force field atom types are added by the selected leaprc
 file.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
charge The charge property is a NUMBER that represents the ATOM's electrostatic
 point charge to be used in a molecular mechanics force field.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
element The atomic element provides a simpler description of the atom than
 the type, and is used only for LEaP's internal purposes (typically when
 force field information is not available).
 The element names correspond to standard nomenclature; the character 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is used for special cases.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
position This property is a LIST of NUMBERs.
 The LIST must contain three values: the (X, Y, Z) Cartesian coordinates
 of the ATOM.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
RESIDUEs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
RESIDUEs are complex objects that contain ATOMs.
 RESIDUEs are collections of ATOMs, and are either molecules (e.g., formaldehyde)
 or are linked together to form molecules (e.g., amino acid monomers).
 RESIDUEs have several properties that can be changed using the 
\family typewriter
set
\family default
 command.
 (Note that database RESIDUEs are each contained within a UNIT having the
 same name; the residue GLY is referred to as GLY.1 when setting properties.
 When two of these single-UNIT residues are joined, the result is a single
 UNIT containing the two RESIDUEs.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One property of RESIDUEs is connection ATOMs.
 Connection ATOMs are ATOMs that are used to make linkages between RESIDUEs.
 For example, in order to create a protein, the N-terminus of one amino
 acid residue must be linked to the C-terminus of the next residue.
 This linkage can be made within LEaP by setting the N ATOM to be a connection
 ATOM at the N-terminus and the C ATOM to be a connection ATOM at the C-terminus.
 As another example, two CYX amino acid residues may form a disulfide bridge
 by crosslinking a connection atom on each residue.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are several properties of RESIDUEs that can be modified using the
 
\family typewriter
set
\family default
 command.
 The properties are described below:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
connect0 This defines the first of up to three ATOMs that are used to make
 links to other RESIDUEs.
 In UNITs containing single RESIDUEs, the RESIDUE's connect0 ATOM is usually
 defined as the UNIT's head ATOM.
 (This is how the standard library UNITs are defined.) For amino acids, the
 convention is to make the N-terminal nitrogen the connect0 ATOM.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
connect1 This defines the second of up to three ATOMs that are used to make
 links to other RESIDUEs.
 In UNITs containing single RESIDUEs, the RESIDUE's connect1 ATOM is usually
 defined as the UNIT's tail ATOM.
 (This is done in the standard library UNITs.) For amino acids, the convention
 is to make the C-terminal oxygen the connect1 ATOM.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
connect2 This defines the third of up to three ATOMs that are used to make
 links to other RESIDUEs.
 In amino acids, the convention is that this is the ATOM to which disulfide
 bridges are made.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
restype This property is a STRING that represents the type of the RESIDUE.
 Currently, it can have one of the following values: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

undefined
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

solvent
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

protein
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

nucleic
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

saccharide
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Some of the LEaP commands behave in different ways depending on the type
 of a residue.
 For example, the solvate commands require that the solvent residues be
 of type 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

solvent
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 It is important that the proper character case be used when defining this
 property.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
name The RESIDUE name is a STRING property.
 It is important that the proper character case be used when defining this
 property.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
UNITs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
UNITs are the most complex objects within LEaP, and the most important.
 They may contain RESIDUEs and ATOMs.
 UNITs, when paired with one or more PARMSETs, contain all of the information
 required to perform a calculation using AMBER.
 UNITs can be created using the 
\family typewriter
createUnit
\family default
 command.
 RESIDUEs and ATOMs can be added or deleted from a UNIT using the 
\family typewriter
add
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
remove
\family default
 commands.
 UNITs have the following properties, which can be changed using the 
\family typewriter
set
\family default
 command:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
head
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
tail These define the ATOMs within the UNIT that are connected when UNITs
 are joined together using the sequence command or when UNITs are joined
 together with the PDB or PREP file reading commands.
 The tail ATOM of one UNIT is connected to the head ATOM of the next UNIT
 in any sequence.
 (Note: a TER card in a PDB file causes a new UNIT to be started.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
box This property can either be null, a NUMBER, or a LIST.
 The property defines the bounding box of the UNIT.
 If it is defined as null then no bounding box is defined.
 If the value is a single NUMBER, the bounding box will be defined to be
 a cube with each side being 
\shape italic
box
\shape default

\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

√Ö across.
 If the value is a LIST, it must contain three NUMBERs, the lengths of the
 three sides of the bounding box.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
cap This property can either be null or a LIST.
 The property defines the solvent cap of the UNIT.
 If it is defined as null, no solvent cap is defined.
 If it is a LIST, it must contain four NUMBERs.
 The first three define the Cartesian coordinates (X, Y, Z) of the origin
 of the solvent cap in √Ö, while the fourth defines the radius of the solvent
 cap, also in √Ö.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Examples of setting the above properties are
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
set dipeptide head dipeptide.1.N 
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
set dipeptide box { 5.0 10.0 15.0 } 
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
set dipeptide cap { 15.0 10.0 5.0 8.0 }
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first example makes the amide nitrogen in the first RESIDUE within 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

dipeptide
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 the head ATOM.
 The second example places a rectangular bounding box around the origin
 with the (X, Y, Z) dimensions of ( 5.0, 10.0, 15.0 ) in √Ö.
 The third example defines a solvent cap centered at ( 15.0, 10.0, 5.0 ) √Ö
 with a radius of 8.0
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

√Ö.
 Note: the 
\family typewriter
set cap
\family default
 command does not actually solvate, it just sets an attribute.
 See the 
\family typewriter
solvateCap
\family default
 command for a more practical case.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Complex objects and accessing subobjects
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
UNITs and RESIDUEs are complex objects.
 Among other things, this means that they can contain other objects.
 There is a loose hierarchy of complex objects and what they are allowed
 to contain.
 The hierarchy is as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
UNITs can contain RESIDUEs and ATOMs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
RESIDUEs can contain ATOMs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The hierarchy is loose because it does not forbid UNITs from containing
 ATOMs directly.
 However, the convention that has evolved within LEaP is to have UNITs directly
 contain RESIDUEs which directly contain ATOMs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Objects that are contained within other objects can be accessed using dot
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 notation.
 An example would be a UNIT which describes a dipeptide ALA-PHE.
 The UNIT contains two RESIDUEs each of which contain several ATOMs.
 If the UNIT is referenced (named) by the variable dipeptide, then the RESIDUE
 named ALA can be accessed in two ways.
 The user may type one of the following commands to display the contents
 of the RESIDUE:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
desc dipeptide.ALA
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
desc dipeptide.1
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first command translates to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

describe some RESIDUE named ALA within the UNIT named dipeptide
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The second form translates as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

describe the RESIDUE with sequence number 1 within the UNIT named dipeptide
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The second form is more useful because every subobject within an object
 is guaranteed to have a unique sequence number.
 If the first form is used and there is more than one RESIDUE with the name
 ALA, then an arbitrary residue with the name ALA is returned.
 To access ATOMs within RESIDUEs, either of the following forms of command
 may be used:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
desc dipeptide.1.CA
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
desc dipeptide.1.3
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Assuming that the ATOM with the name CA has a sequence number 3 within RESIDUE
 1, then both of the above commands will print a description of the alpha-carbon
 of RESIDUE dipeptide.ALA or dipeptide.1.
 The reader should keep in mind that dipeptide.1.CA is the ATOM, an object,
 contained within the RESIDUE named ALA within the variable dipeptide.
 This means that dipeptide.1.CA can be used as an argument to any command
 that requires an ATOM as an argument.
 However dipeptide.1.CA is not a variable and cannot be used on the left hand
 side of an assignment statement.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Running LEaP
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
tleap -h
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
will give a list of command-line arguments (which are very simple).
 Once you have started either program, typing 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

help
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 will display useful information about possible actions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A file called 
\emph on
leaprc
\emph default
 is executed as a script file at the start of the LEaP session unless the
 user suppresses it with the 
\emph on
-s
\emph default
 command line option.
 Sample script files are in 
\emph on
$AMBERHOME/dat/leap/cmd
\emph default
, and you may wish to copy one of these to become "your" default file.
 LEaP will look first for a 
\emph on
leaprc
\emph default
 file in the user's current directory, then in any directories included
 with 
\emph on
-I
\emph default
 flags.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The command line interface allows the user to specify a log file that is
 used to log all input and output within the command line environment.
 The log file is named using the 
\emph on
logFile
\emph default
 command.
 The file has two purposes: to allow the user to see a complete record of
 operations performed by LEaP, and to help recover from (and recreate) program
 crashes.
 Output from LEaP commands is written to the log file at a verbosity level
 of 2 regardless of the verbosity level set by the user using the 
\emph on
verbosity
\emph default
 command.
 Each line in the log file that was typed in by the user begins with the
 two characters "> " (a greater-than sign followed by a space).
 This allows the user to extract the commands typed into LEaP from the log
 file to create a script file that can be executed using the 
\emph on
source
\emph default
 command.
 This provides a type of insurance against program crashes by allowing the
 user to regenerate their interactive sessions.
 An example of a command that will create a script to reenact a LEaP session
 is:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
cat LOGFILE | grep "^> " | sed "s/^> //" > SOURCEFILE.x 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Basic instructions for using LEaP to build molecules
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This section gives an overview of how LEaP is most commonly used.
 Detailed descriptions of all the commands are given in the next section.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Building a Molecule For Molecular Mechanics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to prepare a molecule within LEaP for AMBER, three basic tasks
 need to be completed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Any needed UNIT or PARMSET objects must be loaded;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The molecule must be constructed within LEaP;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The user must output topology and coordinate files from LEaP to use in AMBER.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The most typical command sequence is the following:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
source leaprc.protein.ff14SB 
\emph on
(load a force field) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
x = loadPdb trypsin.pdb 
\emph on
(load in a structure)
\emph default
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
....
 
\emph on
add in cross-links, solvate, etc.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
saveAmberParm x prmtop prmcrd 
\emph on
(save files) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are a number of variants of this:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Although 
\family typewriter
loadPdb
\family default
 is by far the most common way to enter a structure, one might use 
\family typewriter
loadOff
\family default
, or 
\family typewriter
loadAmberPrep
\family default
, or use the 
\family typewriter
zMatrix
\family default
 command to build a molecule from a Z-matrix.
 For small molecules, e.g., ligand like, 
\family typewriter
loadMol2
\family default
 or 
\family typewriter
loadMol3
\family default
 are available.
 See the Commands section below for descriptions of these options.
 If you do not have a starting structure (in the form of a PDB file), LEaP
 can be used to build the molecule; you will find, however, that this is
 not always a straightforward process.
 Many experienced Amber users turn to other (commercial and non-commercial)
 programs to create their initial structures.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Be very attentive to any errors produced in the 
\family typewriter
loadPdb
\family default
 step; these generally mean that LEaP has misread the file.
 A general rule of thumb is to keep editing your input PDB file until LEaP
 stops complaining.
 It is often convenient to use the 
\family typewriter
addPdbAtomMap
\family default
 or 
\family typewriter
addPdbResMap
\family default
 commands to make systematic changes from the names in your PDB files to
 those in the Amber topology files; see the leaprc files in 
\shape italic
$AMBERHOME/dat/leap/cmd
\shape default
 for examples of this.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The 
\family typewriter
saveAmberParm
\family default
 command cited above is appropriate for most force fields; for polarizable
 calculations you will need to use 
\family typewriter

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Amino Acid Residues
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For each of the amino acids found in the LEaP libraries, there has been
 created an N-terminal and a C-terminal analog.
 The N-terminal amino acid UNIT/RESIDUE names and aliases are prefaced by
 the letter N (e.g., NALA) and the C-terminal amino acids by the letter C
 (e.g., CALA).
 If the user models a peptide or protein within LEaP, they may choose one
 of three ways to represent the terminal amino acids.
 The user may use (1) standard amino acids, (2) protecting groups (ACE/NME),
 or (3) the charged C- and N-terminal amino acid UNITs/RESIDUEs.
 If the standard amino acids are used for the terminal residues, then these
 residues will have incomplete valences.
 These three options are illustrated below:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
{ ALA VAL SER PHE } 
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
{ ACE ALA VAL SER PHE NME } 
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
{ NALA VAL SER CPHE }
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The default for loading from PDB files is to use N- and C-terminal residues;
 this is established by the 
\family typewriter
addPdbResMap
\family default
 command in the standard leaprc files.
 To force incomplete valences with the standard residues, one would have
 to define a sequence (
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

 x = { ALA VAL SER PHE }
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) and use 
\family typewriter
loadPdbUsingSeq
\family default
, or use 
\family typewriter
clearPdbResMap
\family default
 to completely remove the mapping feature.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Histidine can exist either as the protonated species or as a neutral species
 with a hydrogen at the 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon$
\end_inset

 position.
 For this reason, the histidine UNIT/RESIDUE name is either HIP, HID, or
 HIE (but not HIS).
  The standard leaprc files assign the name HIS to HIE.
 Thus, if a PDB file is read that contains the residue HIS, the residue
 will be assigned to the HIE UNIT object.
 This feature can be changed within one's own leaprc file.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The AMBER force fields also differentiate between the residue cysteine (CYS)
 and the similar residue which participates in disulfide bridges, cystine
 (CYX).
 The user will have to explicitly define, using the 
\family typewriter
bond
\family default
 command, the disulfide bond for a pair of cystines, as this information
 is not read from the PDB file.
 In addition, the user will need to load the PDB file using the 
\family typewriter
loadPdbUsingSeq
\family default
 command, substituting CYX for CYS in the sequence wherever a disulfide
 bond will be created.

\begin_layout Section
Error Handling and Reporting
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In Amber version 18 changes were made to LEaP's error processing.
 The first set of changes involve error handling.
 For input from a file (i.e., 
\family typewriter
tleap invoked with -f
\family default
 ) execution is now terminated at the first occurrence of these errors:
 file input/output errors, illegal command syntax, illegal command arguments,
 and some command parsing errors.
 The intent is to simplify error detection and to ease troubleshooting.
 For interactive input there is no change in handling: LEaP continues to
 be forgiving of these errors in the hope that the user can recover in real
 time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
 The final set of changes involve error reporting.
 LEaP produces four kinds of messages: errors, warnings, notes, and processing
 messages.
 Messages beginning with "Fatal Error!" or "Error!" or "Error:" indicate
 a serious problem.
 Messages beginning with "Warning!" or "Warning:" indicate a potential problem
 that should be investigated.
 Messages beginning with "Note." or "Note:" provide information worth noting.
 Messages that are not designated by one of the above tags report processing
 status.
 Total counts of errors, warnings, and notes are outputted at the end of
 LEaP.
 The intent is to simplify error detection by emitting clear and consistent
 messages.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
 As with all computational software, LEaP's output should be carefully examined.
 Some error and warning  messages mention likely causes or contain suggested
 workarounds, but all such messages provide clues.
 Apply common sense and the scientific method to troubleshoot.
 Typical first steps are to verify input files and to search the AMBER Mail
 Reflector for similar reported problems.
 Note that LEaP normally produces a log file that contains all messages
 and more detailed output that can be inspected.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Known Issues
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
 This is an incomplete list, started with Amber version 24, focussing on
 incompatibilities with standards, significant bugs, and gotchas in 
\shape italic
LEaP
\shape default
:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
LEaP does not write Mol2 files that are compliant with Sybyl bond types
 in the  @<TRIPOS>BOND record.
  As of Amber version 24, single, double, and triple bond types are correctly
 emitted; the number 4 is used to denote aromatic bonds.
 In previous versions, the number 1 was always emitted.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A workaround exists for the num lock issue in xLEaP; contact the Amber mailing
 list for details.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Of course other issues should be reported via the Amber mailing list.

\begin_layout Section
Commands
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The following is a description of the commands that can be accessed using
 the command line interface in 
\shape italic
tleap
\shape default
, or through the command line editor in 
\shape italic
xleap
\shape default
.
 Whenever an argument in a command line definition is enclosed in square
 brackets (e.g., 
\family typewriter
[arg]
\family default
), then that argument is optional.
 When examples are shown, the command line is prefaced by 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

> 
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and the program output is shown without this character preface.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some commands that are almost never used have been removed from this description
 to save space.
 You can use the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

help
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 facility to obtain information about these commands; most only make sense

 If solvent is present, it is ignored in the charge and steric calculations,
 and if an ion has a steric conflict with a solvent molecule, the ion is
 moved to the center of that solvent molecule, and the latter is deleted.
 (To avoid this behavior, either solvate _after_

 This procedure is not guaranteed to globally minimize the electrostatic

 Since

then both

\begin_layout Standard
Note that in a few instances, the copy command does not produce an exact
 copy.
 This is particularly relevant when making copies of oligosaccharide residues.
 In these, the copy command invariably inverts chirality at the anomeric
 carbon.
 The workaround for this is to use the copy command twice, where the second
 call inverts the chirality back.

\begin_layout Standard

 If the group has already been defined then overwrite the old group.
 The

desc
\family default

 Example:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An expression like 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 returns a LIST, so any commands that require LISTs can take advantage of
 this notation.
 After assignment, one can access groups using the

 Examples:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

 unit seqlist internals
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\family typewriter
impose
\family default
 command allows the user to impose internal coordinates on 
\shape italic
unit
\shape default
.
 The list of RESIDUEs to impose the internal coordinates upon is in 
\shape italic
seqlist
\shape default
.
 The internal coordinates to impose are in 
\shape italic
internals
\shape default
, which is an object of type LIST.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The command works by looking into each RESIDUE within 
\shape italic
unit
\shape default
 that is listed in 
\shape italic
seqlist
\shape default
 and attempts to apply each of the internal coordinates within 
\shape italic
internals
\shape default
.
 The 
\shape italic
seqlist
\shape default
 argument is a LIST of NUMBERS that represent sequence numbers or ranges
 of sequence numbers.
 A range of sequence numbers is represented by two element LISTs that contain
 the first and last sequence number in the range.
 The user can specify sequence number ranges that are larger than what is
 found in 
\shape italic
unit
\shape default
, in which case the range will stop at the beginning or end of 
\shape italic
unit
\shape default
 as appropriate.
 For example, the range { 1 999 } will include all RESIDUEs in a 200 RESIDUE
 UNIT.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The internals argument is a LIST of LISTs.
 Each sublist contains a sequence of ATOM names which are of type STRING
 followed by the value of the internal coordinate.
 An example of the impose command would be:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
impose peptide { 1 2 3 } { { 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

N
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

C
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 -60.0 } }
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This would cause the RESIDUE with sequence numbers 1, 2, and 3 within the
 UNIT 
\shape italic
peptide
\shape default
 to assume an 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

-helical conformation.
 The command
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
impose peptide { 1 2 { 5 10 } 12 } { { 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

CA
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

CB
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 5.0 } }
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
will impose on the residues with sequence numbers 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,
 and 12 within the UNIT 
\shape italic
peptide
\shape default
 a bond length of 5.0
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

√Ö between the 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 carbon atoms.
 RESIDUEs without an ATOM named CB, such as glycine, will be unaffected.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is important to understand that the impose command attempts to perform
 the intended action on all residues in the
\shape italic
 seqlist
\shape default
, but does not necessarily limit itself to acting only upon
\shape italic
 internals
\shape default
 contained within those residues.
 That is, the list does not limit the residues to consider.
 Rather, it is a list of all starting points to consider.
 In other words, to specify a
\shape italic
 seqlist
\shape default
 of { 3 4 } tells
\shape italic
 impose
\shape default
 to attempt to set two torsions, one starting in residue 3 and the other
 starting in residue 4.
 It does not specify that the torsion should only be set if the atoms are
 found within residues 3 and/or 4.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because of this, one must be careful when setting torsions between two residues.
 It is necessary to know which atoms are contained in which residues.
 Consider the following trisaccharide:
\begin_inset Separator latexpar
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align center
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

\shape smallcaps

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To build it most simply in LEaP requires the following directive.
 Note that the build order in LEaP is the reverse of the standard order
 in which the residues are written above.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
glycan = sequence { ROH 6LB 6MB 0GA } 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A proper build of a 1-6 oligosaccharide linkage often requires setting three
 torsions.
 In the manner that residues are defined in the Glycam force fields, the
 atoms describing two of those torsions, 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

, span two residues.
 However, the atoms in the third, 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

, exist entirely within one residue.
 In fact, they exist within all three glycan residues in the example above.
 The following commands will set only the three torsions in the glycosidic
 linkage between residues 4 (0GA) and 3 (6MB).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
impose glycan { 4 } { { 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

C6
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 -60.0 } } # O6 & C6 are in residue 3
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
impose glycan { 4 } { { 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

C1
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

O6
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

C6
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

C5
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 180.0 } } # only C1 is in residue 4
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
impose glycan { 3 } { { 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

O6
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

O5
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 60.0 } } # all are in residue 3
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The common misconception that the
\shape italic
 seqlist
\shape default
 sets a limit on the residues affected can cause trouble in this case.
 For example, this command
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
impose glycan { 4 3 } { { 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

H1
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

C1
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

O6
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

C6
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 -60.0 } } 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
will find all sequences beginning in residue 4 and in residue 3 that contain
 the serially bonded atoms H1 C1 O6 and C6.
 Therefore, in this case, it will set the specified torsions between residues
 4 and 3 as well as between 3 and 2.
 Similarly, this command
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
impose peptide { 4 } { { 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

O6
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

C6
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

C5
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

O5
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 60.0 } } 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
will not affect any inter-residue linkage, but instead will set the C5-C6
 torsion in the glucopyranoside (0GA) at the non-reducing end of the oligosaccha
ride.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The ordering and content within the
\shape italic
 internals
\shape default
 list is important as well.
 For these examples, consider the simple peptide sequence:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
peptide = sequence { ALA ALA ALA ALA } 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The ordering of the
\shape italic
 internals
\shape default
 specifies the atoms to which the torsion set is applied.
 The
\shape italic
 impose
\shape default
 command will find the first atom in the 
\shape italic
internals
\shape default
 list, check for the presence of a bonded second atom, and so forth.
 It will then apply the action, here a torsion, to those four atoms.
 For example, this command:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
impose peptide { 3 } { { 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

N
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

CA
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

C
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

N
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 -40.0 } }  # between 3 and 4
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
will set the torsion between residues 3 and 4.
 However, this one:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
impose peptide { 3 } { { 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

N
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

C
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

CA
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

N
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 -40.0 } }  # between 3 and 2 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
will set the torsion between residues 3 and 2.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If at any point, the
\shape italic
 impose
\shape default
 command does not find an atom bonded to a previous atom in an
\shape italic
 internals
\shape default
 list, it will silently ignore the command.
 This is likely to occur in two instances.
 One, the atom simply might not exist in the residue:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
impose peptide { 3 } { { 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

N
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

CA
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

CB
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

HB4
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 10.0 } }  # no effect, silent 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here, of course, there is no atom named HB4 in alanine.
 Similarly, improper torsions are ignored.
 For example, this command also has no effect:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
impose peptide { 3 } { { 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

N
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

HB1
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

CA
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

CB
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 10.0 } }  # no effect, silent 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
because HB1 is not bonded to N.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Three types of conformational change are supported: Bond length changes,
 bond angle changes, and torsion angle changes.
 If the conformational change involves a torsion angle, then all dihedrals
 around the central pair of atoms are rotated.
 The entire list of internals is applied to each RESIDUE.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is also important to note that the impose command performs its actions
 entirely using internal coordinates.
 Because of this, it is difficult to predict the resulting behavior when
 the coordinates are translated back to cartesian, for example when writing
 a PDB file.

 The sequence numbers of the RESIDUEs will be determined from the order
 of residues within the PDB file ATOM records.
 This function will search the variables currently defined within LEaP for
 variable names that map to residue names within the ATOM records of the
 PDB file.
 If a matching variable name is found then the contents of the variable
 are added to the UNIT that will contain the structure being loaded from
 the PDB file.
 Adding the contents of the matching UNIT into the UNIT being constructed
 means that the contents of the matching UNIT are copied into the UNIT being
 built and that a bond is created between the connect0 ATOM of the matching
 UNIT and the connect1 ATOM of the UNIT being built.
 (This bond creation does not occur if a PDB `TER' card separates the  
 atoms.
  As of AmberTools21 a PDB TER record is also used to detect a new residue
 in the case of contiguous residues with identical residue sequence numbers.)
 The UNITs are combined in the same way UNITs are combined using the sequence
 command.
 As atoms are read from the ATOM records their coordinates are written into
 the correspondingly named ATOMs within the UNIT being built.
 If the entire residue is read and it is found that ATOM coordinates are
 missing, then external coordinates are built from the internal coordinates
 that were defined in the matching UNIT.
 This allows LEaP to build coordinates for hydrogens and lone-pairs which
 are not specified in PDB files.
  Note that the standard leaprc files include  commands to establish automatic
 N- and C-termination of amino acid  sequences and 5' and 3' termination
 of nucleic acid sequences.

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\family typewriter
sequence
\family default
 command is used to combine the contents of 
\shape italic
list
\shape default
, which should be a LIST of UNITs, into a new, single UNIT.
 This new UNIT is constructed by taking each UNIT in 
\shape italic
list
\shape default
 in turn and copying its contents into the UNIT being constructed.
 As each new UNIT is copied, a bond is created between the tail ATOM of
 the UNIT being constructed and the head ATOM of the UNIT being copied,
 if both connect ATOMs are defined.
 If only one is defined, a warning is generated and no bond is created.
 If neither connection ATOM is defined then no bond is created.
 As each RESIDUE is copied into the UNIT being constructed it is assigned
 a sequence number which represents the order the RESIDUEs are added.
 Sequence numbers are assigned to the RESIDUEs so as to maintain the same
 order as was in the UNIT before it was copied into the UNIT being constructed.
 This command builds reasonable starting coordinates for all ATOMs within
 the UNIT; it does this by assigning internal coordinates to the linkages
 between the RESIDUEs and building the external coordinates from the internal
 coordinates from the linkages and the internal coordinates that were defined
 for the individual UNITs in the sequence.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
box This property defines the bounding box of the UNIT (
\shape italic
container
\shape default
).
 If
\shape italic

\shape default
 is set to null then no bounding box is defined.
 If it is a single NUMBER, the bounding box will be defined to be a cube
 with each side being NUMBER
\begin_inset space ~

solute
\shape default
 and the edge of the periodic box is given by the 
\shape italic
distance
\shape default
 parameter.
 The resulting solvent box will be repeated in all three spatial directions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the distance parameter is a single NUMBER then the minimum distance is
 the same for the x, y, and z directions, unless the STRING "iso" parameter
 is specified to make the box or truncated octahedron isometric.
 For solvateBox if "iso" is used, the solute is rotated to orient the principal
 axes, otherwise it is just centered on the origin.
 For solvateOct if the "iso" option is used, the isometric truncated octahedron
 is rotated to an orientation used by the PME code, and the box and angle
 dimensions output by the saveAmberParm* commands are adjusted for PME code
 imaging.In solvateBox, if the distance parameter is a LIST of three NUMBERS
 then the NUMBERs are applied to the x, y, and z axes respectively.
 As the larger box is created and superimposed on the solute, solvent molecules
 overlapping the solute are removed.In solvateOct, when a LIST is given for
 the distance parameter, four numbers are given instead of three, where
 the fourth is the diagonal clearance.
 If 0.0 is given as the fourth number, the diagonal clearance resulting from
 the application of the x,y,z clearances is reported.
 If a non-0 value is given, this may require scaling up the other clearances,
 which is also reported.
 Similarly, if a single NUMBER is given, any scaleup of the x,y,z buffer
 to accommodate the diagonal clip is reported.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The optional 
\shape italic
closeness
\shape default
 parameter can be used to control how close, in √Ö, solvent ATOMs may come
 to solute ATOMs.
 The default value of 
\shape italic
closeness
\shape default
 is 1.0.
 Smaller values allow solvent ATOMs to come closer to solute ATOMs.
 The criterion for rejection of overlapping solvent RESIDUEs is if the distance
 between any solvent ATOM and its nearest solute ATOM is less than the sum
 of the two ATOMs' van der Waals radii multiplied by 
\shape italic
closeness

.

 If

 then the geometric center of the ATOM or ATOMs within the object will be

\shape default
 parameter can be used to control how close, in √Ö, solvent ATOMs may come

 is 1.0.
 Smaller values allow solvent ATOMs to come closer to solute ATOMs.
 The criterion for rejection of overlapping solvent RESIDUEs is if the distance
 between any solvent ATOM and its nearest solute ATOM is less than the sum
 of the two ATOMs' van der Waals radii multiplied by

Antechamber and GAFF
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These are a set of tools to generate files for organic molecules and for
 some metal centers in proteins, which can then be read into LEaP.
 The Antechamber suite was written by Junmei Wang, and is designed to be
 used in conjunction with the general AMBER force field (GAFF) (gaff.dat).

 for an explanation of the algorithms used to classify atom and bond types,
 to assign charges, and to estimate force field parameters that may be missing
 in gaff.dat.
 The python Metal Site Modeling Toolbox (pyMSMT) software package was developed
 by Pengfei Li, and is described in Section

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Like the traditional AMBER force fields, GAFF uses a simple harmonic function
 form for bonds and angles.
 Unlike the traditional AMBER force fields, atom types in GAFF are more
 general and cover most of the organic chemical space.
 In total there are 33 basic atom types and 22 special atom types.
 The charge methods used can be HF/6-31G* RESP, AM1-BCC,
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 or ABCG2.

\end_inset

 The force field parametrization was performed entirely with HF/6-31G* RESP
 charges.
 (Note that in AM1-BCC, the QM electrostatic potentials that were used as
 fitting targets were created in a very slightly different manner and then
 compared to RESP charges, using different scaling factors (i.e.
 0.001/0.01

 versus 0.0005/0.001

.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To maintain force field integrity and to achieve the best performance, the
 following is the overall guidance on choosing force fields and charge models.
 Both gaff and gaff2 were developed using HF/6-31G* RESP charge, therefore,
 RESP charge is compatible with both general AMBER force fields.
 It was found that gaff/bcc combination achieves good performance in many
 scenarios including solvation free energy calculations.
 For the efficient charge models, bcc or abcg2, gaff/bcc and gaff2/abcg2
 combinations are recommended, while gaff2/bcc or gaff/abcg2 are not.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The van der Waals parameters are the same as those used by the traditional
 AMBER force fields.
 The equilibrium bond lengths and bond angles came from 
\shape italic
ab initio
\shape default
 calculations at the MP2/6-31G* level and statistics derived from the Cambridge
 Structural Database.
 The force constants for bonds and angles were estimated using empirical
 models, and the parameters in these models were trained using the force
 field parameters in the traditional AMBER force fields.
 General torsional angle parameters were extensively applied in order to
 reduce the huge number of torsional angle parameters to be derived.
 The force constants and phase angles in the torsional angle parameters
 were optimized using our PARMSCAN package,
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

 with an aim to reproduce the rotational profiles depicted by high-level
 
\shape italic
ab initio
\shape default
 calculations (geometry optimizations at the MP2/6-31G* level, followed
 by single point calculations at MP4/6-311G(d,p)).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By design, GAFF is a complete force field (so that missing parameters rarely
 occur); it covers almost all the organic chemical space that is made up
 of C, N, O, S, P, H, F, Cl, Br and I.
 Moreover, GAFF is totally compatible with the AMBER macromolecular force
 fields.
 It should be noted that GAFF atom types, except metal types, are in lower
 case, while AMBER atom types are always in upper case.
 This feature makes it possible to load both AMBER protein/nucleic acid
 force fields and GAFF without any conflict.
 One can even merge the two kinds of force fields into one file.
 The combined force fields are capable of studying complicated systems that
 include both proteins/nucleic acids and organic molecules.
 We believe that the combination of GAFF with AMBER macromolecular force
 fields will provide a useful molecular mechanical tool for rational drug
 design, especially in binding free energy calculations and molecular docking
 studies.
 Since its introduction, GAFF has been used for a wide range of applications,
 including ligand docking,

\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The following is the detailed explanations of some flags
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
-nc This flag specifies the net charge of the input molecule, otherwise,
 the net charge is read in from the input directly (such as gout, mopout,
 sqmout, sqmcrt, gcrt, etc.) or calculated by summing the partial charges
 (such as mol2, prepi, etc).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
-a,-fa,-ao Sometimes, one wants to read additional information from another
 file other than the input, the '-ao' flag informs the program to read in
 which information from the additional file specified with '-a' flag.
 In Example (11), a mol2 file is generated from a Gaussian output file with
 atom names read in from a pdb file.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
-ch,-gk,-gm,-gn Those flags specify the keywords and resource usage in Gaussian
 calculations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
-ge,-gv The '-ge' flag specifies the file name of gesp file generated using
 iop(6/50=1) with Gaussian 09; the -gv flag specifies the Gaussian version
 and the default is '1' for Gaussian 09.
 If one wants to generate Gaussian input files (gcrt and gzmat) for older
 Gaussian versions, '-gv' must be set to '0'.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
-rn The '-rn' line specifies the residue name to be used; thus, it must
 be one to three characters long.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
-at This flag is used to specify whether atom types are to be created for
 the GAFF force field or for atom types consistent with parm94.dat and parm99.dat
 (i.e., the AMBER force fields).
 If you are using 
\shape italic
antechamber
\shape default
 to create a modified residue for use with the standard AMBER parm94/parm99
 force fields, you should set this flag to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

amber
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

; if you are looking at a more arbitrary molecule, set it to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

gaff
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, even if the molecule is intended for use as a ligand bound to a macromolecule
 described by the AMBER force fields.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
-j This flag instructs the program how to run 'bondtype' and 'atom type'.
 '-j 1' assumes the bond types already exists; '-j 4' first predicts the
 connectivity table, then assigns bond and atom types sequentially; '-j
 5' reads in connectivity table from the input and then run 'bondtype' and
 'atomtype' sequentially.
 In most situations, '-j 4', the default option, is recommended.
 However, '-j 5' should be used if the input structure is not good enough
 and it includes the bond connectivity information (such as mol2, mdl, gzmat,
 etc.) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
-eq This flag specifies how to do charge equilibration.
 With '-eq 1', atomic charge equilibration is predicted only by atom paths,
 in another word, if two or more atoms have exactly same sets of atom paths,
 they are equivalent and their charges are forced to be same.
 While '-eq 2' predicts charge equilibration using both atom paths and some
 geometrical information (E/Z configuration).
 With the '-eq 2' option, the charges of two hydrogen atoms bonded to the
 No 2 carbon of chloroethene are different as they adopt different configuration
s to chlorine (one is cis and the other is trans).
 Similarly, the two amide hydrogen atoms of acetamide do not share the same
 partial charge as the amide bond cannot rotate freely.
 To back-compatible to the older versions, the default is set to '1'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In Example (12), a gcrt file of iodine methane is generated and a gesp file
 named ch3I.gesp is produced when running Gaussian 09 with the default keyword.
 In Examples (13-15), RESP charges are generated for acetamide using different
 charge equilibration options.
 In the following table, the charges are listed for comparison purposes.

).
 It writes out a force field modification (frcmod) file containing any force
 field parameters that are needed for the molecule but not supplied by the

 Problematic parameters, if any, are indicated in the frcmod file with the
 note,

, and are typically given values of zero.
 This can cause fatal terminations of programs that later use a resulting
 prmtop file; for example, a zero value for the periodicity of the torsional
 barrier of a dihedral parameter will be fatal in many cases.
 For each atom type, an atom type corresponding file (ATCOR.DAT) lists its
 replaceable general atom types.
 By default, only the missing parameters are written to the frcmod file.

\begin_layout Standard
Unlike 
\emph on
parmchk
\emph default
 which only checks several substitutions for a missing force field parameter,
 
\emph on
parmchk2
\emph default
 enumerates all the possible substitutions and select the one with the best
 similarity score as the final substitute.
 Moreover, a penalty score, which measures the similarity between the missing
 force field parameter and the substitute is provided.
 The similarity socres are calculated using the similarity indexes defined
 in the atom type similarity index file (PARMCHK.DAT).
 A similarity index of a pair of atom types ('A/B') for a specific force
 field parameter type was generated by calculating the average percent absolute
 error of two set of force field parameters in gaff.
 The two set of force field parameters are identical except that one set
 has atom type 'A' and the other has 'B'.
 Each atom type pair ('A/B') has nine similarity indexes for nine different
 types of force field parameters, which are bond equilibrium length, bond
 stretching force constant, bond equilibrium angle ('A' and 'B' are central
 atoms), bond angle bending force constant ('A' and 'B' are central atoms),
 bond equilibrium angle ('A' and 'B' are non-central atoms), bond angle
 bending force constant ('A' and 'B' are non-central atoms), torsional angle
 twisting force constant ('A' and 'B' are inner side atoms), torsional angle
 twisting force constant ('A' and 'B' are outter side atoms), and improper
 dihedral angle.

\begin_layout Section
A simple example for antechamber
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The most common use of the antechamber program suite is to prepare input
 files for LEaP, starting from a three-dimensional structure, as found in
 a PDB file.
 The antechamber suite automates the process of developing a charge model
 and assigning atom types, and partially automates the process of developing
 parameters for the various combinations of atom types found in the molecule.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As with any automated procedure, the output should be carefully examined,
 and users should be on the lookout for any unusual or incorrect program
 behavior.

This command says that the input format is pdb, output format is Sybyl mol2,
 and the BCC charge model is to be used.
 The output file is shown in the box titled .mol2.
 The format of this file is a common one understood by many programs.
 However, to display molecules properly in software packages other than
 LEaP and gleap, one needs to assign atom types using the '-at sybyl' flag
 rather than using the default gaff atom types.

In this case, there were two missing dihedral parameters from the gaff.dat
 file, which were assigned a default value.
 (As gaff.dat continues to be developed, there should be fewer and fewer
 missing parameters to be estimated by parmchk2.) In rare cases, parmchk2
 may be unable to make a good estimate; it will then insert a placeholder
 (with zeros everywhere) into the frcmod file, with the comment "ATTN: needs
 revision".
 After manually editing this to take care of the elements that "need revision",
 you are ready to read this residue into LEaP, either as a residue on its
 own, or as part of a larger system.
 The following LEaP input file (leap.in) will just create a system with thiopheno
l in it:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
source leaprc.gaff

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\begin_layout Standard
You can read this into LEaP as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
tleap -s -f leap.in 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This will yield a prmtop and inpcrd file.
 If you want to use this residue in the context of a larger system, you
 can insert commands after the loadAmberPrep step to construct the system
 you want, using standard LEaP commands.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this respect, it is worth noting that the atom types in gaff.dat are all
 lower-case, whereas the atom types in the standard AMBER force fields are
 all upper-case.
 This means that you can load both gaff.dat and (say) parm99.dat into LEaP
 at the same time, and there won't be any conflicts.
 Hence, it is generally expected that you will use one of the AMBER force
 fields to describe your protein or nucleic acid, and the gaff.dat parameters
 to describe your ligand; as mentioned above, gaff.dat has been designed
 with this in mind, i.e., to produce molecular mechanics descriptions that
 are generally compatible with the AMBER macromolecular force fields.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The procedure above only works as it stands for neutral molecules.
 If your molecule is charged, you need to set the -nc flag in the initial
 antechamber run.
 Also note that this procedure depends heavily upon the initial 3D structure:
 it must have all hydrogens present, and the charges computed are those
 for the conformation you provide, after minimization in the AM1 Hamiltonian.
 In fact, this means that you must have an reasonable all-atom initial model
 of your molecule (so that it can be minimized with the AM1 Hamiltonian),
 and you may need to specify what its net charge is, especially for those
 molecular formats that have no net charge information, and no partial charges
 or the partial charges in the input are not correct.
 The system should really be a closed-shell molecule, since all of the atom-typi
ng rules assume this implicitly.

Further examples of using antechamber to create force field parameters can
 be found in the 
\shape italic

\shape default
 directory.
 Here are some practical tips from Junmei Wang:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
For the input molecules, make sure there are no open valences and the structures
 are reasonable.
 All hydrogen atoms must be present.
 Antechamber doesn't know what to do with metal ions (see the MCPB.py program
 for that), or for other non-organic elements such as Boron.
 Look at the 
\emph on
$AMBERHOME/dat/leap/parm/gaff.dat
\emph default
 file to see what sorts of atomic environments are supported.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The Antechamber package produces two kinds of messages: error messages and
 informative messages.
 Informative messages begin with "Info:" and may be safely ignored, but
 they may be helpful for understanding and troubleshooting antechamber.
 For example: "Info: Bond types are assigned for valence state 1 with penalty
 of 1".
 Messages beginning with "Fatal Error!" or "Error:" indicate a problem.
 Some such messages may mention likely causes or contain suggested workarounds,
 but all such messages provide clues.
  Apply common sense and the scientific method to troubleshoot.
  Typical first steps are to verify input files and to search the AMBER
 Mail Reflector for similar reported problems.
 Additional steps are described below.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Failures are most often produced when antechamber infers an incorrect connectivi
ty.
 In such cases, you can revise by hand the connectivity information in "ac"
 or "mol2" files.
 Systematic errors could be corrected by revising the parameters in $AMBERHOME/d
at/antechamber/CONNECT.TPL.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
It is a good idea to check the intermediate files in case of a program failure,
 and you can run separate programs one by one.
 Use the "-s 2" flag to antechamber to see details of what it is doing.

 If you encounter failures when running antechamber programs, it is highly

 Run the acdoctor program or use the acdoctor mode in program antechamber;
 the latter is controlled by option '-dr' and is on by default.

 bond type assignments are performed.
 The '-j' option of 3 and 5 implies that bond type information (single bond,

 are single bond, double bond, triple bond, aromatic single, aromatic double
 bonds and delocalized bond.
 This program takes an ac file or mol2 file as input and write out an ac
 file with the predicted bond types.
 After the continually improved algorithm and code, the current version
 of bondtype can correctly assign bond types for most organic molecules
 (>99% overall and >95% for charged molecules) in our tests.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Starting with Amber 10, bond type assignment is proceeded based upon residues.
 The bonds that link two residues are assumed to be single bonded.
 This feature allows antechamber to handle residue-based molecules, even
 proteins are possible.
 It also provides a remedy for some molecules that would otherwise fail:
 it can be helpful to dissect the whole molecule into residues.
 Some molecules have more than one way to assign bond types; for example,
 there are two ways to alternate single and double bonds for benzene.
 The assignment adopted by bondtype is purely affected by the atom sequence
 order.
 To get assignments for other resonant structures, one may freeze some bond
 types in an 
\emph on
ac
\emph default
 or 
\emph on
mol2
\emph default
 input file (appending 'F' or 'f' to the corresponding bond types).
 Those frozen bond types are ignored in the bond type assignment procedure.
 If the input molecules contain some unusual elements, such as metals, the
 involved bonds are automatically frozen.
 This frozen bond feature enables bondtype to handle unusual molecules in
 a practical way without simply producing an error message.

\emph on
acdoctor
\emph default
 reads the same input file formats used by the
\emph on
antechamber
\emph default
 program and 'diagnoses' potential issues that can cause antechamber to
 fail.
 In AmberTools version 17 the acdoctor functionality was added to program
 antechamber; it is controlled by option '-dr' and is on by default.
 The first step is to validate some commonly-used molecular formats, such
 as pdb, mol2, mdl (sdf), etc.
 Then the presence of any unusual elements (elements other than C, O, N,
 S, P, H, F, Cl, Br and I) is reported; in AmberTools version 19 the unusual
 elements check was changed from a warning to a fatal error; please contact
 the Amber Mail Reflector specifying the unusual element(s) to register
 your interest in using antechamber on those element(s).
 Unfilled valences are reported and additional checks are performed when
 atom types and/or bond types are read for file formats ac, mol2, sdf, prepi,
 prepc, mdl, alc and hin.
 The geometry is quantified by a distance matrix and atomic clashes are
 reported.
 
\emph on
acdoctor
\emph default
 also applies a more stringent criterion than that utilized by 
\emph on
antechamber
\emph default
 to determine whether a bond is formed or not.
 A warning message is printed for those bonds that fail to meet the standard
 as well as for weird bonds.
  Next
\emph on
acdoctor
\emph default
 determines whether all atoms are linked together through atomic paths.
 If not, an error message is printed.
 This kind of error typically implies that the input molecule has one or
 several bonds missing.
 Finally, 
\emph on
acdoctor
\emph default
 tries to assign bond types and atom types for the input molecule.
 If no error occurs during running 
\emph on
bondtype
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
atomtype
\emph default
, presumably the input molecule should be free from problems when running
 the other Antechamber programs.
 It is recommended to diagnose your molecules with 
\emph on

\emph default
 when you encounter Antechamber program suite failures.

\begin_layout Standard
One limitation of the Antechamber package is that the atom name information
 is lost after running Gaussian calculations.
 And a residue topology file in prepi or prepc or a mol2 file generated
 from the Gaussian output has atom names not matching those from the original
 file (usually a pdb file).
 Because of this glitch, one can not simply load the residue topology file
 to tleap, read in the pdb file and then to save the topolgoy.
 We developed match_atomname to address this problem.
 The match_atomname program takes an input file and a reference file in
 pdb, ac, prepi, prepc and mol2 format, automatically detects the corresponding
 atom name in the reference for each atom name in the input.
 An output file in the same format as that of the input is generated using
 the matched atom names.

With the correct AMBER parameters, calculations performed at a quantum level
 over many conformations of a structures should match those calculated by

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

 to input quantum data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For energies, 
\emph on
Paramfit
\emph default
 attempts to fit the AMBER energy to the quantum energy for a variety of
 conformations of the input structure, minimizing the equation 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\sum_{n=1}^{N}w_{i}\Big[\big(E_{MM}(n)-E{}_{QM}(n)\big)^{2}+K\Big]=0
\]

\end_inset

 where K is a constant that adjusts for different origins in the QM and
 MM calculations so that minimization may be done to zero and N is the number
 of molecular conformations that are considered.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For forces, the equation that is optimized is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\sum_{n=1}^{N}\sum_{atom=1}^{N_{atoms}}w_{i}\big|F(n,atom)_{MM}-F(n,atom)_{QM}\big|^{2}=0
\]

\end_inset

 where the sum of the differences in the forces on each atom should match
 given the correct set of parameters.
 Individual structures can be assigned weights 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{i}$
\end_inset

to give them more or less relative importance in the fit.
 By default, all weights are set to 1.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The program works by altering the parameters that AMBER uses to describe
 the molecule, which alter the elements in the AMBER sum that is used to
 calculate the energy or forces.
 It is necessary to evaluate over many conformations of the molecule because
 the parameters should predict how the molecule will behave dynamically
 rather than statically.
 To get a good idea of the forces on a dihedral, for example, the energy
 needs to be evaluated for multiple conformations of the dihedral to see
 how it changes each time.
 
\emph on
Paramfit 
\emph default
will fit so that the energy changes that AMBER predicts will happen when
 the dihedral twists match the changes predicted with quantum methods.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to facilitate force field development, 
\emph on
Paramfit
\emph default
 supports fitting parameters across multiple molecules (for example, fitting
 a single dihedral backbone term across a variety of input amino acids).
 Single molecule fits can also be done to generate parameters that are missing
 or inadequate to describe small molecules or ligands.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Paramfit 
\emph default
provides functionality for the majority of steps in the fitting process,
 including writing input files for quantum packages, specifying which parameters
 are to be fit, determining the value of K for the system, and finally conductin
g the fit and saving it in a force field modification file that can be used
 by other programs.
 An external quantum program is needed to generate the energies needed for
 
\emph on
paramfit
\emph default
 to conduct a fitting.
 Currently, the program is capable of writing input files for ADF, GAMESS,
 and Gaussian, although if you write your own input files instead of using
 
\emph on
paramfit's 
\emph default
functionality, any quantum package will work.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Paramfit has OpenMP support for parallelization of the AMBER function evaluation
 over the input conformations, where each core will evaluate the energy
 for a subset of the conformations.

\emph on
Paramfit
\emph default
 now includes several ways fitting functions to aid in parameter generation.
 It can fit such that the energy of each input structure matches the single-poin
t quantum energies inputted, or can now do the same fitting only with the
 forces on each atom, which may produce a more accurate fit that is less
 sensitive to problems with the input structure, and can also fit all dihedral
 force constants and phases simultaneously to a small set of quantum energies
 using a method developed by Chad Hopkins and Adrian Roitberg.
 This method fits every term and requires fewer function evaluations than
 running the full minimization algorithm, but requires especially good sampling
 of each torsion angle of interest.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Fitting forces requires several additional options to specify the location
 of the output forces files in the job control file.
 The easiest way to create a job control file for any of these options is
 to use the wizard, which runs automatically when no job control file is
 specified.
 This will walk you through the creation of a job control file and write
 it for you while prompting for all necessary options for the selected fitting
 function.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is highly recommended that you fit to single-point quantum energies,
 as fitting to forces is considerably more expensive in terms of required
 calculation and still somewhat experimental.
 The implementation of the dihedral fitting method is requires a varied
 set of input structures, and does not allow specifying individual dihedrals
 to be fit.
 No matter which method is used, please take care to carefully validate
 all parameters for reasonableness‚Äì 
\emph on
paramfit's
\emph default
 fit is dependent on the variation and quality of the input structures and
 the resulting parameters are not guaranteed in ill-defined areas of the
 input conformation set.
 For example, if you fit a dihedral torsion term with input structures sampling
 the 0-30 degree range of that dihedral, the resulting parameters cannot
 be expected to give a valid energy of a structure with the dihedral at
 90 degrees, as the algorithm merely fits to the available data and cannot
 make other predictions.

Usage
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Paramfit is called from the command line as follows for a single molecule
 fit:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\begin_layout Standard
Running 
\emph on

without any options will run a wizard that assists in the creation of a
 job control file.
 It is highly recommended that you use the wizard to assist you in setting
 run options.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The following switches apply to single molecule fits only:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
-p prmtop The molecular topology file for the structure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
-c mdcrd A coordinate file containing many conformations of the input structure.
 These may be generated by running a short simulation in solution, or by
 manually specifying coordinates for each atom.
 It is important that there be a good representation of the solution space
 for any parameters that are to be optimized‚Äì for example, if you want a
 bond force constant it would be a good idea to have input structures with
 a good range of values for the length of the that bond type.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to facilitate batch runs as well as simplify the process of running
 
\emph on
paramfit
\emph default
 on larger systems, the parameters to be fit are saved and then loaded in
 during actual fitting so that they do not have to be specified every time.
 The parameter setting runtype accomplishes this by prompting whether you
 would like to fit bond, angle and/or dihedral parameters and then displaying
 a list of the specific atom types for each so that you can pick exactly
 what 
\emph on

 should optimize.
 This saved file does not specify a value for any of the parameters, but
 simply indicates which ones are to be changed during fitting.

Algorithm options
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Paramfit
\emph default
 implements two minimization algorithms: a simplex and a hybrid simplex-genetic
 algorithm (GA).
 The current version of 
\emph on
paramfit
\emph default
 incorporates numerous refinements to the genetic algorithm that require
 much less input from the user‚Äì it is no longer necessary to choose between
 the simplex or GA.
 This improved algorithm means that iterative fits are no longer necessary,
 and the algorithm will converge very close to or at the global minimum
 on a single run.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The genetic algorithm starts with a randomly generated solution set, which
 it recombines and alters in ways similar to evolution.
 The GA will start with many initial randomly generated sets of parameters.
 It will then determine which are the best by evaluating the AMBER sum,
 select them for recombination to produce a new set of parameters, randomly
 alter a few parameters slightly to prevent premature convergence, and iterate.
 Once several 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

generations
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 have passed without improvement, a loosely converging simplex algorithm
 is run on a random subset of the population, which is then allowed to recover
 for several generations before further simplex iterations are conducted.
 This hybrid approach dramatically speeds convergence to the global minimum,
 while maintaining the strengths of the genetic algorithm in searching a
 large, complex solution space with low sampling.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The following options in the job control file will control the behavior
 of the genetic algorithm.
 In general the default values for these options is sufficient to produce
 good results, and alterations to them will speed convergence.
 Options marked 
\emph on
internal algorithm parameter 
\emph default
should not need to be altered by the vast majority of users, as they are
 already set to their optimum.
 The algorithm's results should be independent of these values if they are
 within reasonable ranges (run the wizard for suggestions).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
OPTIMIZATIONS The integer number of possible optimizations the algorithm
 will use.
 Analogous to the population size in evolution; larger values require more
 function evaluations and are slower but produce better initial sampling,
 and smaller ones will delay convergence.
 Defaults to 50.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
SEARCH_SPACE If positive, the algorithm will search for new parameters for
 everything except dihedral phases within this percentage of the original
 value, where 1.0 will search within 
\begin_inset Formula $\pm100\%$
\end_inset

 of the value found in the input 
\emph on
prmtop
\emph default
.
 Defaults to searching over the entire range of valid values and ignoring
 the original value in the topology file.
 You may wish to alter this value if you know that the original parameters
 are good and you wish to search in their neighborhood.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
MAX_GENERATIONS The maximum number of iterations the algorithm is allowed
 to run before it returns the best non-converged optimization.
 Defaults to 50,000.
 If you find that you repeatedly need to increase this value compared to
 the default, there are likely significant problems with your system or
 insufficient input structures.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
GENERATIONS_TO_SIMPLEX The number of iterations in a row that must pass
 without improvement in the best parameter set for simplex refinements to
 be run on a random 5% of the populations.
 Set to 0 for a pure genetic algorithm.
 Smaller values will speed convergence but may result in retrieval of local
 minima.
 Defaults to 10.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
GENERATIONS_WITHOUT_SIMPLEX The number of generations that must pass between
 runs of simplex refinement, regardless of improvement in the best parameter
 set.
 These iterations serve as a recovery period for the population of the genetic
 algorithm, and allows time for the simplex results to be incorporated.
 If set to small or zero values, simplex refinement may run too often, resulting
 in convergence to a local minima and eliminating the global search properties
 of the genetic algorithm.
 Defaults to 10.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
GENERATIONS_TO_CONV The number of iterations in a row that must pass without
 improvement in the best parameter set for the algorithm to be considered
 converged.
 Set to a larger value for a longer but potentially more accurate run.
 Defaults to 50, which is too large for most systems.
 This counter increments along with the counter to trigger simplex refinement,
 and at the global minimum simplex refinement will produce no improvement
 on the population, allowing convergence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
MUTATION_RATE 
\emph on
Internal algorithm parameter 
\emph default
The chance an allele (potential parameter) in the genetic algorithm population
 has to be randomly set to a new value each generation.
 Defaults to 0.05.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
PARENT_PERCENT 
\emph on
Internal algorithm parameter
\emph default
 The percentage of each generation that is allowed to pass on alleles to
 the next generation.
 Defaults to 0.25.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The simplex algorithm is excellent at refining a good set of input parameters,
 but can converge on physically unreasonable values (such as negative bond
 force constants) if given a naive guess.
 For this reason, the genetic algorithm is recommended for finding the global
 minimum or a close approximation thereof, and the simplex algorithm may
 be run on the resulting parameters to confirm the results, if desired.
 The simplex algorithm starts at an initial set of parameters and moves
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

downhill
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 iteratively while sampling neighboring areas (much like an amoeba crawling
 along the function landscape), and converges when the improvement from
 one step to another becomes negligible.
 The simplex algorithm is generally faster than the GA, and excels at well-defin
ed systems with a small number of dimensions.
 This algorithm requires a very well-defined sample space, and the input
 structures should contain a good range over all the bonds, angles, and
 dihedrals that are to be optimized.
 Otherwise, the algorithm tends to wander and will converge in badly defined
 areas of the sample set.
 In smaller, well-defined systems with only a few parameters, this algorithm
 will outperform the genetic algorithm.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Choose the simplex algorithm if you wish to fit only a few parameters and
 have a large number of input conformations.
 You may specify the following options to fine-tune the step sizes taken,
 but for the vast majority of cases the defaults should suffice:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
BONDFC_dx Intrinsic length of parameter space for minimization.
 Used to determine the size of the steps to construct the initial simplex.
 Should be large enough that the steps sample a sufficiently large area
 but small enough to not move outside of normal parameter range.
 Bond force constant step size defaults to 5.0.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
BONDEQ_dx Bond equilibrium length step size.
 Defaults to 0.02.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
ANGLEFC_dx Angle force constant step size.
 Defaults to 1.0.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
ANGLEEQ_dx Angle equilibrium step size.
 Defaults to 0.05.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
DIHEDRALBH_dx Dihedral force constant step size.
 Defaults to 0.2.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
DIHEDRALN_dx Dihedral periodicity step size.
 Defaults to 0.01.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
DIHEDRALG_dx Dihedral phase step size.
 Defaults to 0.05.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
K_dx Step size for intrinsic difference constant.
 Defaults to 10.0.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
CONV_LIMIT Floating point number that details the convergence limit for
 the minimization.
 The smaller the number, the longer the algorithm will take to converge
 but the results may be more accurate.
 Defaults to 1.0E-15, which is very strict.
\end_layout

Bounds Checking
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to ensure that the algorithms can return meaningful results, bounds
 checking routines are included in 
\emph on
paramfit.
 
\emph default
The bounds checking functionality ensures that the algorithm's results are
 reasonable given the initial sample set, and also makes sure that the sample
 set is well-defined.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since bonds and angles are approximately harmonic, the algorithm's result
 is reasonable if it lies within a well-defined area of the sample set.
 Bonds and angle values are therefore checked after the algorithm has finished
 running.
 In order to properly fit dihedrals, sample structures should span the entire
 range of phases for each dihedral that is to be fit.
 Dihedral checking is therefore accomplished before the algorithm begins
 to conduct the fit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Bounds checking defaults to halting execution of the program upon reaching
 a failing condition.
 It is not recommended that this behavior be disabled, since the results
 of the fit are most likely inaccurate.
 Using the fitted parameters anyway will probably result in an inaccurate
 depiction of the molecule.
 Properly represented parameters in the input structures are crucial for
 a valid fit.
 Instead of using the parameters, fix the input structures so that data
 are provided in the missing ranges, which will be stated in the error message,
 and rerun the program twice: first in CREATE_INPUT mode to obtain quantum
 energies for the added structures and then in FIT mode to redo the fit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you 
\series bold
know
\series default
 that your input structures describe the parameters to be fit quite well,
 the selectivity of the bounds checking can be altered by the specifying
 the following options in the job control file.
 Use these options with caution, and verify the generated parameters carefully.

\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Description
BOND_LIMIT Fitting results for bond lengths that are this many Angstroms
 away from the closest approximation in the input structures will result
 in a failing condition.
 Defaults to 0.1.

Multiple molecule fits
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Paramfit
\emph default
 supports fitting one or more parameters across multiple molecules, and
 contains several features to aid in force field development.
 The program is invoked differently, using a prmtop list and mdcrd list
 that specify topology and structures for each molecule to fit.
 Since the value of K is also system-dependent, you will need to fit K for
 each molecule individually.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Input topologies are specified in a 
\emph on
prmtop list, 
\emph default
which contains the filename of each topology and the value of K for that
 system, separated by a space.
 There are no comments permitted in this file.
 For example:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
molecule1.prmtop 50.0
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
molecule2.prmtop 100.0
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To obtain the value of K for each topology file, conduct a single-molecule
 fit using all the structures corresponding to that topology and put the
 resulting value in this file.
 This enables fitting to zero over multiple molecules.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Input coordinate files are stated in the 
\emph on
coordinate list, 
\emph default
which contains the filename of each coordinate set, the number of structures
 contained in it, and the filename containing the energy of each structure,
 separated by a space.
 Each energy file is exactly the same as single-molecule fits, containing
 the energy of each structure, one per line, in the same order as the correspond
ing coordinate file.
 If there are more structures available in the coordinate file than the
 number N specified, the first N structures will be used in the fit.
 An example coordinate list would be:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
molecule1.mdcrd 200 energy1.dat
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
molecule2.mdcrd 100 energy2.dat
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parameters to fit must be present in all of the available topologies, and
 the parameter specification file (PARAMETER_FILE_NAME) should be created
 using a single-molecule invocation of 
\emph on
paramfit.
 
\emph default
Saved output files such as energy profile will be named according to the
 input file name, and a single frcmod will be written if specified.
 A multiple molecule invocation of 
\emph on
paramfit 
\emph default
uses the following command line options:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
paramfit -i Job_Control.in -pf prmtop_list -cf mdcrd_list [-v MEDIUM] [--random-s
eed seed]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The only alteration to the job control file necessary for multiple molecule
 fits is the deletion of the NSTRUCTURES parameter.
 NSTRUCTURES should not be specified as it is now ambiguous and will result
 in a program error.

Fitting Forces
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Paramfit 
\emph default
can fit to the forces on each atom within an input structure rather than
 to single point energies.
 In theory, this provides more data to the fitting algorithm and reduces
 noise by considering only the forces on atoms involved in a fitted parameter
 in the function evaluation.
 This section will walk you through the process of fitting forces using
 
\emph on
paramfit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Currently, force fitting can only read in Gaussian output files, so input
 files will be created in the format accepted by that program.
 Specify in the QMHEADER file the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

force
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 keyword, so Gaussian will print out the forces on each atom, and run 
\emph on
paramfit
\emph default
 in the CREATE_INPUT mode as normal.
 Then run Gaussian on those input files, keeping the resulting output with
 the same naming scheme, for example appending 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

.out
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to the name of an input file to indicate its input.
 For example, in bash:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
for i in `ls output/Job.*.gjf`; do g09 < $i > $i.out; done
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To run a fit with forces, you must specify the following options in the
 job control file, or use the wizard.
 
\emph on
Paramfit 
\emph default
will read in the output files from the Gaussian job using the same order
 and naming scheme, so alter the QM filename parameters so that they match
 the suffix you appended to Gaussian output files.

The fitting process with 
\emph on

follows a specific order.
 Example job control files for each step and a description of the step follow.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First, write a job control file to create the input structures and run 
\emph on
paramfit:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
RUNTYPE=CREATE_INPUT
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
# Trajectory has 50 structures

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
$AMBERHOME/bin/paramfit -i Job_Control.in -p prmtop -c mdcrd
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After all 50 input files have been created, run the quantum program on them.
 Once it's finished, extract the quantum energies from the output files
 using the provided script, or write your own.
 Since the example used Gaussian:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
$AMBERHOME/AmberTools/src/paramfit/scripts/process_gaussian.x 
\backslash

\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
output_directory energies.dat
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now, or while the quantum jobs are running, since neither the energies nor
 the structures are needed yet, determine which parameters are to be fit
 and save them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\begin_layout LyX-Code

Evaluating Results
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When using 
\emph on
paramfit
\emph default
, it is important to verify the accuracy of the fitted parameters for your
 input structures.
 The WRITE_ENERGY option in the Job Control file is useful for this.
 Set it to a filename and 
\emph on
paramfit 
\emph default
will write the final AMBER energy of each structure next to the quantum
 energy for the same structure in a file that can be easily graphed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you have gnuplot, a script has been provided to quickly show each structure's
 energies.
 Assuming your energy file is named energy.dat:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
$AMBERHOME/AmberTools/src/paramfit/scripts/plot_energy.x energy.dat
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The resulting graph makes the identification of problem structures much
 easier, and gives a good visualization of the fit.
 In general, carefully validate parameters generated by 
\emph on
paramfit
\emph default
 against other data before conducting large simulations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The SCATTERPLOT option in the job control file can also be useful in assessing
 the quality of the input structures.
 If this option is set, 
\emph on
paramfit
\emph default
 will dump a variety of data files indicating the value for all fitted bonds,
 angles, and dihedrals in the input conformations.
 These data may be visualized if you have the program gnuplot by running
 the following command in the directory where 
\emph on
paramfit
\emph default
 was run:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
$AMBERHOME/AmberTools/src/paramfit/scripts/scatterplots.sh
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The resulting graphs feature different colored points for each bond, angle,
 and dihedral type that is being fit for each of the input structures.
 This is useful in evaluating if the results of the fit are reasonable‚Äì
 for example, if the algorithm converges with an equilibrium bond length
 that is not similar to any of the structures, that parameter may not be
 accurate.
