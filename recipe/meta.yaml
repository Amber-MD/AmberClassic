    summary: 'Subset of AmberTools, built around a "modern" version of sander; includes other useful tools'
    description: |
      This repository contains msander, a "modern" version of parts of the
      Amber molecular dynamics program sander. Also included are various
      NMR, X-ray and cryoEM-related code and utilities, as well as versions
      of a number of the "classic" (and commonly-used) parts of AmberTools:
      tleap, antechamber, sqm, sff, mdgx, metatwist, rism1d, saxs, gbnsr6,
      xtalutil, protonate, packmol and paramfit. All of the force
      field files from AmberTools are also included here. With these tools,
      many systems can be set up for simulation in msander.
