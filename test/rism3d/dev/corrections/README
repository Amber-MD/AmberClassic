3D-RISM Correction Tests
========================

Tests in this directory are meant to reproduce Universal Correction
(UC) and Initial State Correction (PCPLUS) results for excess chemical
potential, solvation energy and solvation entropy as obtained by
Johnson et al. Unlike PCPLUS, UC results depend on the specific
values of fit coefficients. So, these results are only valid for the
coefficients in Run.mol, which are not exactly the same as those
published.

Data from Johnson et al., for comparison, can be found in data.tsv
(tab separated values). Most results should agree to 5-6 digits.
Solvation energy and entropy for methane only agree to about 3 digits
due to differences in the calculated partial molar volume.

In reality, this is a set of regression tests as we test against
previously 3D-RISM runs and not the data in data.tsv.
