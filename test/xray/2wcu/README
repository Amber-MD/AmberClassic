This is a simple test case for pdb entry 2WCU, and room-temp P1 crystal

The SolvXtal.pdb has water added, but the waters might not be in good
positions.  The B-factors in this file were just copied from the original
pdb entry.

The 2wcu-sf.dat file is a table of observed structure factors, just extracted
from the mmcif file deposited with the pdb.

Some data files, all with values in the same order as in 2wcu-sf.dat:

sfall_F.dat    values computed from the xray structure using sfall
obs_F.dat      deposited structure factors
xray_F.dat     calculated by Juno's program
xray_Fobs.dat  (scaled) observed F's as printed by Juno's program
